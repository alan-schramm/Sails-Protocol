# Load tests (k6)

Real k6 scripts against the real server — every flow here goes through
the actual routes (`src/core/intent.routes.ts`, `src/modules/open-p2p/`,
`src/modules/open-settlement/`, `src/modules/open-reputation/`) with
real Ed25519 challenge-response auth (`common/middleware/auth.ts`), the
same "mock only the database boundary a unit test needs to, never the
thing actually being proven" discipline this repo's e2e (Playwright) and
load-tests/artillery/ (Artillery) suites already established.

This is a **second, separate load-testing tool alongside
`load-tests/artillery/`** (Artillery, moved from the former top-level
`loadtest/` — PRODUCTION_READINESS_FIXES.md item 19, closed 2026-08-08,
so both suites live under one parent directory), not a replacement —
nothing in this repo's docs/RFCs planned a k6 suite before this phase;
it was a net-new ask. The two don't overlap in what they test today:
`load-tests/artillery/` covers Intent API
throughput and the chat WebSocket; this suite adds trade/escrow
lifecycle, reconciliation, and reputation lookups, plus k6's
purpose-built load-*shape* scenarios (ramps, spikes, soak) that
Artillery's phase config can't express as directly.

## Prerequisites

1. **k6 itself** — not an npm package, a standalone binary:
   ```
   winget install --id GrafanaLabs.k6 -e
   ```
   (or see https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/set-up/install-k6/ for
   other platforms). Verify with `k6 version`.

2. **Local Postgres + Redis**, same as every other real-backend suite in
   this repo:
   ```
   npm run db:local:start
   npm run redis:local:start
   ```
   (or `docker-compose up -d` — either path, see `docs/DEVELOPER_JOURNEY.md`).

3. **The real server, with rate limits raised.** At shipped defaults
   (`RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_MAX=10`/min, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100`/min —
   `src/config/index.ts`, RT-002) any of these scripts will mostly
   measure the rate limiter within the first few seconds — a real,
   correct result, just not what "Intent/trade/escrow throughput" means.
   `load-tests/artillery/README.md` already documents this exact tradeoff for
   Artillery; the same override works here:
   ```
   RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_MAX=100000 RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100000 TRUSTED_ARBITRATORS=k6-test-arbiter npm run dev
   ```
   `TRUSTED_ARBITRATORS` isn't exercised by anything in this suite today
   (no test drives dispute resolution), but is included above since a
   real deployment needs it set before disputes work at all — harmless
   to include, and one less thing to remember if a future test needs it.

## Structure

```
load-tests/
  k6.config.js            — BASE_URL + options shared by every scenario/test
  utils/
    data-generator.js      — generateTestUser (real Ed25519 auth), generateTestIntent, generateTestOffer, generateTestTrade
    metrics.js              — custom Trend/Rate/Counter metrics, shared names across files
    thresholds.js           — standard / strict / relaxed presets
  tests/                    — one real flow each, runnable standalone or imported by a scenario
    intent-creation.js
    trade-lifecycle.js
    escrow-operations.js
    reconciliation.js
    reputation-lookup.js
  scenarios/                — load *shapes*, each driving a realistic mix of the 5 flows above
    smoke-test.js
    average-load.js
    stress-test.js
    soak-test.js
    spike-test.js
    _shared-workload.js     — the mixed-workload composition every scenario file uses (not meant to be run directly)
```

## Running a specific flow

Each file in `tests/` is runnable on its own, with its own sensible
default load shape:

```bash
k6 run load-tests/tests/intent-creation.js      # 100 req/s create+cancel, 30s
k6 run load-tests/tests/trade-lifecycle.js      # 10 VUs, full trade cycle, 30s
k6 run load-tests/tests/escrow-operations.js    # 15 VUs, create->lock->payment-sent->release, 30s
k6 run load-tests/tests/reconciliation.js       # 50 req/s against one real ongoing trade, 30s
k6 run load-tests/tests/reputation-lookup.js    # 200 req/s, leaderboard + single lookups, 30s
```

Override the target if not running locally on the default port:

```bash
k6 run -e BASE_URL=http://staging.example.com:3000 load-tests/tests/intent-creation.js
```

## Running a load-shape scenario

```bash
k6 run load-tests/scenarios/smoke-test.js       # 5 VUs, 1 minute — run this first, always
k6 run load-tests/scenarios/average-load.js     # ramps to 100 VUs, holds, ramps down
k6 run load-tests/scenarios/stress-test.js      # ramps to 1000 req/s — finds where it breaks
k6 run load-tests/scenarios/spike-test.js       # 50 -> 500 -> 50 req/s — tests recovery, not just peak
k6 run load-tests/scenarios/soak-test.js        # 50 VUs, 4 hours — do NOT run this by accident
```

Each scenario drives a realistic mixed workload across all 5 real flows
(weighted toward reads — see `scenarios/_shared-workload.js`'s own
comment for the exact split and why), not one single endpoint.

### The soak test specifically

`soak-test.js` runs for **4 real hours** as written — that's the point
(catching degradation nothing shorter would surface; see the file's own
header comment). Don't run it unmodified unless you actually mean to
tie up a machine for 4 hours. To sanity-check the script itself works
without committing to the full run, override VUs/duration from the CLI
— this **replaces** the file's own `options.scenarios` entirely, it
doesn't add to it:

```bash
k6 run --vus 5 --duration 2m load-tests/scenarios/soak-test.js
```

## Thresholds

Three presets in `utils/thresholds.js`, selected per scenario file
(`standard` for smoke/average/soak, `relaxed` for stress/spike — see
each scenario's own header comment for why). All three cover k6's
built-in `http_req_duration`/`http_req_failed` plus this suite's custom
per-flow success-rate metrics (`sails_*_success`).

| Preset     | p95 duration | p99 duration | error rate | per-flow success |
|------------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| `strict`   | <100ms       | <250ms       | <0.1%      | >99.9%            |
| `standard` | <200ms       | <500ms       | <1%        | >99%              |
| `relaxed`  | <1000ms      | <3000ms      | <10%       | >90%              |

`standard`'s numbers aren't arbitrary — they're set against the actual
results already on record for this backend
(`docs/whitepapers/TECHNICAL_WHITEPAPER.md` section 12: Intent API p95
32ms/p99 55ms on one local machine, zero failures, 30s/20rps sustained),
with headroom. `strict` is meant as a real CI regression gate — tighter
than today's numbers, so it catches a real slowdown before it ships, not
just confirms the status quo.

Swap a scenario's preset without editing the file:

```bash
k6 run -e THRESHOLD_PROFILE=strict load-tests/scenarios/smoke-test.js
```

(only wires up if a file calls `selectThresholds(__ENV.THRESHOLD_PROFILE)`
in its own `options.thresholds` — the shipped scenario files import a
fixed preset directly instead, matching the table above; use
`selectThresholds` in your own copy if you want the env-var switch.)

## Interpreting results

k6's own end-of-run summary is the primary output — read it in this
order:

1. **`✓`/`✗` checks** — did the real assertions (status codes) hold.
   Zero `✗` is the first thing to look for.
2. **`http_req_failed`** — the aggregate error rate. Compare against the
   threshold table above for whichever preset you ran.
3. **`sails_*_success`** — per-flow success rate. If `http_req_failed`
   is low but one specific `sails_X_success` is low, the failure is
   concentrated in one flow, not spread evenly — look at that flow's
   own `tests/*.js` file next.
4. **`sails_*_duration` / `http_req_duration`** — the actual latency
   distribution (p90/p95/p99), not just the average. A low average with
   a high p99 usually means a real tail-latency problem (a slow query
   under contention, a GC pause), not "usually fine."
5. **`sails_rate_limited_429`** (metrics.js) — a real, *expected*
   nonzero count if you forgot the rate-limit-raise step above; a
   nonzero count with limits already raised is a real finding worth
   investigating, not routine.

A threshold failure at the end of a run exits k6 with a non-zero status
code — that's what a CI job should gate on, not manual reading of the
summary (see below).

## CI/CD

```bash
# Smoke test as a merge gate — fast, catches "something is fundamentally broken"
k6 run --quiet load-tests/scenarios/smoke-test.js

# Non-zero exit code on any threshold breach — CI can just check $?
echo "k6 exited with status $?"
```

A real CI environment needs the same three prerequisites listed above
(Postgres+Redis up, server running with rate limits raised) — this
suite doesn't spin those up itself, matching `load-tests/artillery/`'s own existing
convention of treating that as the runner's job, not the test's.

`stress-test.js`/`soak-test.js` are deliberately **not** meant for a
per-PR CI gate (too slow, and stress/soak results are inherently
machine-dependent) — run those on a schedule against a stable
environment instead, and compare trends over time rather than gating a
single run pass/fail.

## A real, non-obvious gotcha this suite's own development ran into

k6's JS engine (Goja) is not Node or a browser — `tweetnacl`
(`data-generator.js`'s real Ed25519 signing, needed for the real auth
flow) auto-detects its environment via a UMD footer that checks
`typeof self` (browser) then `typeof require` (Node) to wire up its
random-number source. k6 has neither a `self` global nor a requirable
`'crypto'` module (it exposes Web Crypto as a real global `crypto`
instead) — so tweetnacl's own auto-detect picks the Node branch and
crashes on `require('crypto')`. The fix, already applied in
`data-generator.js`: set `globalThis.self = globalThis` before loading
tweetnacl via `require()` (not `import` — ES module imports are hoisted
and would run before that polyfill line executes, regardless of where
the `import` statement is textually written). Confirmed by testing
directly against a real k6 binary before writing anything that depended
on it, not assumed from how this works in Node/Artillery.
