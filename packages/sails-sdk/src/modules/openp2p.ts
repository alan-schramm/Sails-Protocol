/**
 * @satsails/p2p-trading-sdk — Sails OpenP2P module (verified against
 * src/modules/open-p2p/trade.routes.ts and chat.routes.ts directly).
 *
 * Deviation from an earlier draft of SDK_GUIDE.md section 2's signature:
 * that doc originally specified `trade(offerId: string): Promise<Trade>`,
 * but `POST /v1/openp2p/trades`'s real body requires `amount` too
 * (trade.routes.ts) — a two-arg call that omits it would just 400 at
 * runtime, which is worse than an honest three-arg signature here.
 * SDK_GUIDE.md section 2 has since been reconciled (now reads
 * `trade(offerId: string, amount: string): Promise<Trade>`); the section 4
 * example still omits `amount` and remains to be fixed.

 * High-severity finding #1 / docs/TODO.md's own "No WebSocket

 * 2026-08-02): a real WebSocket can't be reopened once closed, so this
 * takes a *factory* (`openSocket`) rather than an already-constructed
 * socket, and calls it again for each reconnect attempt.
 *
 * `openSocket` is now `() => Promise<WebSocket>`, not `() => WebSocket`
 * — disclosed, deliberate second breaking change to this class's own
 * constructor (not to `chat(tradeId)`'s own signature, which is
 * unchanged and still frozen per docs/API_STABLE.md), same justified
 * pre-v1 exception as the first one. Security review finding, 2026-08-15
 * (P1): the query param used to carry the raw, long-lived session token
 * (`?token=`) — reusable, and dangerous to have sitting in a URL that
 * proxies/load balancers commonly log in full. `chat()` below now fetches
 * a short-lived, single-use ticket (`POST /v1/identity/ws-ticket`) before
 * opening each connection attempt, which requires an async step ahead of
 * the actual `new WebSocket(...)` call — hence the factory's new return
 * type. `this.ws` is therefore nullable until the first `openSocket()`
 * resolves; every method that touches it below accounts for that.
