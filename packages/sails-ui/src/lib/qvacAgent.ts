/**
 * Real QVAC agent interaction (2026-08-09) — wraps `sailsClient.agents.*`
 * (`@satsails/p2p-trading-sdk`'s `SailsAgentsModule`, `POST /v1/agents/*` on the real
 * backend, `QvacAgentProvider` / LLAMA_3_2_1B_INST_Q4_0 local inference,
 * no cloud dependency). Was a client-side heuristic simulation until the
 * engineering session shipped the real HTTP surface this same day — a
 * real request relayed from this UI's own backlog (see
 * `docs/BACKLOG.md`'s OpenAgents row for the full history).
 *
 * Same exported function names/shapes as before, deliberately —
 * `AgentIntentionPanel.tsx`/`AgentRiskCard.tsx` don't need to change
 * their call sites, only this file's implementation changed. Both
 * routes require an active session (real inference has a real cost per
 * call, same reasoning the backend applies to capability-grant writes);
 * callers are responsible for not invoking these while logged out — see
 * each component's own `useAuth()` gate.
 *
 * Only `generateTradeIntent()` is used here, for both BUY and SELL
 * goals — this panel's own job is narrowing the Marketplace filter
 * (`onIntentGenerated`), not publishing an offer, so `TradeIntent`'s
 * shape (which includes `currency`) is what this UI actually needs
 * either way. `generateOfferIntent()` (no `currency` field, shaped for
 * an actual offer draft) is real and SDK-exposed too, but has no real
 * consumer in this UI yet — a natural fit for a future "AI-assist" on
 * `PublishOffer.tsx`'s own wizard, not this panel.
