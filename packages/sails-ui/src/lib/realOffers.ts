/**
 * Real Marketplace data — @sails/sdk's `liquidity.discover()`
 * (GET /v1/liquidity/offers), replacing `offersStore.ts`'s mocked
 * MOCK_OFFERS + localStorage layer.
 *
 * `discover()` only filters by asset+side (both required) — no
 * "give me everything" route exists (verified against
 * src/modules/open-liquidity/liquidity.routes.ts directly, same
 * limitation the SDK's own liquidity.ts doc comment already discloses).
 * To show the Marketplace's "Todos" default, this fans out one call per
 * (asset, side) combination and merges — 20 requests worst case (10
 * ASSETS × 2 sides), acceptable for this reference UI's scale, not a
 * pattern a high-traffic production client should copy without a real
 * "list all" backend route.
 *
 * `LiquidityOfferSummary` (the real response shape — see
 * packages/sails-sdk/src/modules/liquidity.ts's own comment for the bug
 * this uncovered) is missing several fields the UI's `Offer` type wants
 * (seller displayName, country, description, requiresKyc, paymentDetails,
 * network) — the real /v1/liquidity/offers route genuinely doesn't
 * return them today. Filled with honest placeholders below, each
 * commented, not silently invented as if real.
