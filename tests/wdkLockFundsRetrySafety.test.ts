/**
 * CTO Mission #56 — WDK_USDT_EVM lockFunds() unknown-outcome / retry-safety
 * evidence (docs/BACKLOG.md's #56, docs/TECHNICAL_DEBT_AUDIT.md #56).
 *
 * Exercises the REAL escrow.service.ts/escrow-lifecycle.ts orchestration
 * (nothing about the claim/revert/retry logic is mocked) against a fake
 * WdkSettlementProvider — only the provider boundary and the database are
 * mocked, the same "mock the boundary, test what's actually new" discipline
 * tests/escrowProviderWiring.test.ts and tests/escrowReleaseControls.test.ts
 * already use for MULTISIG/LIGHTNING_HODL.
 *
 * CTO Gate Correction (2026-09-07): every test below exercises the REAL
 * Sails orchestration (claimEscrowTransition -> provider call -> catch ->
 * revertEscrowStatus -> retry) — that part is DEMONSTRATED, unmocked, and
 * genuinely runs. The external, side-effecting economic action itself
 * (the provider's transfer) is SIMULATED — no real network/RPC call is
 * ever made. No claim in this file requires, or ever required, a real
 * network call; this comment states plainly what was always true so a
 * reader cannot mistake a mocked provider return value for a live
 * transaction.
 *
 * The property under test (not a mechanism): a side-effecting external
 * funding action must not be repeated merely because the caller could not
 * determine whether the first attempt succeeded. escrow.service.ts's
 * existing claimEscrowTransition() (2026-07-20, "robustness-audit fix")
 * already proves CONCURRENT double-calls are safe — two simultaneous
 * lockFunds() requests can't both reach the provider, because only one
 * wins the atomic CREATED->FUNDS_LOCKED claim. That is NOT what this file
 * tests. This file tests the orthogonal, unaddressed case: a SEQUENTIAL
 * retry after the FIRST call's own catch block has already reverted the
 * claim back to CREATED — which happens unconditionally on any throw
 * inside lockFunds()'s try block, including a throw that occurs AFTER the
 * provider's (simulated) side effect already occurred.
