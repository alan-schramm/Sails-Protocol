// tests/integration/postgresTestHarness.ts
//
// Missão 11 Fase 6.3B.1 — single source of truth for every real-Postgres
// integration test's connectivity + safety bootstrap. Replaces 11
// independently-copied beforeAll() probes (7 of which fell back to a
// hardcoded, permanently-unreachable ":5433" connection string and
// silently reported "passed" with zero assertions run — confirmed,
// reproduced false-green, Fase 6.3B §B) with one obvious, canonical path.
//
// Two responsibilities, deliberately not three:
// 1. Fail-CLOSED authorization — a real-Postgres integration test must
//    never run destructive operations against a database nobody
//    explicitly approved for that. No single weak signal (NODE_ENV,
//    a "test" substring in the name, or "it's on localhost") is treated
//    as sufficient alone; all three plus an explicit opt-in are required
//    together. This runs before the connectivity probe, so a missing
//    authorization is itself a test FAILURE, not a skip.
// 2. Fail-LOUD connectivity — once authorized, an unreachable Postgres
//    fails the tests that need it (requirePostgres() throws inside the
//    `it()` body, the same call-site shape every existing caller already
//    uses) rather than quietly no-op'ing while Jest reports green.
//
// Deliberately NOT a framework: no retry policies, no connection
// pooling, no generic "test context" abstraction. One probe, one
// authorization check, one throw helper.

 *
 *  1. SAILS_INTEGRATION_TEST_DB_CONFIRMED is set to the exact expected
 *     value (not just "truthy" — a stray `=1` left in a shared CI
 *     env-var group must not silently authorize this).
 *  2. The resolved DATABASE_URL parses as a valid URL.
 *  3. Its host is on the explicit allowlist (localhost/127.0.0.1/::1,
 *     or an operator-provided SAILS_TEST_DB_EXTRA_HOSTS for CI service
 *     containers reached by a non-localhost hostname).
 *  4. Its database name is non-empty and does not look like a
 *     production database (contains "prod"/"production").
