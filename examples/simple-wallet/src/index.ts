/**
 * @sails/example-simple-wallet
 *
 * The dogfooding test for @sails/sdk (docs/TODO.md §25): a wallet
 * developer's first 15 minutes with the SDK, written using ONLY its
 * public surface (`@sails/sdk`'s exports) — no reaching into this
 * monorepo's internal services, no mocks. It runs the real golden path
 * (register → publish → discover → trade → chat → escrow → release)
 * against a real local Sails node, exactly like a wallet integrating
 * this protocol for the first time would.
 *
 * Prerequisites: a Sails node running locally (`npm run dev` from the
 * repo root — see README.md in this directory for the full walkthrough,
 * including how to point this at a different node via SAILS_BASE_URL).
 *
 * Run: npm run start -w @sails/example-simple-wallet

  // minimum tier (every prior run of this example, plus §22-§26's own
