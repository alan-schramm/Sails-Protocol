/**
 * Sails OpenReputation — Reference Implementation
 *
 * The last module TODO.md's route-restoration pass left genuinely
 * unbuilt — unlike open-identity/open-p2p/open-settlement/open-liquidity,
 * this one had no service layer at all, not just missing routes.
 *
 * RFC-007 D8/D9's rule, enforced structurally here, not just by
 * convention: `recordOutcome()` was the *sole* input to
 * `User.reputationScore` through RFC-021 D6. `rate()` (star ratings)
 * remains informational feedback only — persisted, displayed, never
 * mixed into the score. A trade cancelled by mutual agreement (no
 * dispute ever raised) always classifies Neutral, never Negative — see
 * `recordOutcome`'s callers in `common/events/handlers.ts` for how
 * that's actually decided.
 *
 * **Second legitimate input, added RFC-021 D7 (2026-08-02):**
 * `penalizeForBurnedVouch()` — a real, disclosed exception to "sole
 * input," not a silent violation of it. Peer vouching (D7) extends D3's
 * "reputation as slashable collateral" principle from arbiters to
 * anyone who vouches for a newcomer: if the vouchee's first dispute is
 * lost while the vouch is still active, the voucher's own reputation
 * takes a real hit — the same "skin in the game" reasoning, applied one
 * hop further out. Only ever called from `vouch.service.ts`'s
 * `burnVouchesFor()`, never directly from a route.
 *
 * Known simplification (documented, not hidden — same discipline
 * `DATABASE.md` uses for `Offer.intentType` standing in for
 * `TradeIntent`): `SDK_GUIDE.md`'s `ReputationScore` interface specifies
 * a `{ total, tradeScore, volumeScore, settlementScore, disputeRate }`
 * breakdown. `User.reputationScore` is a single `Float` today — this
 * service computes `total` and `disputeRate` for real, and reports the
 * rest of the shape as zero rather than fabricating sub-scores nothing
 * in this codebase actually tracks separately yet.
