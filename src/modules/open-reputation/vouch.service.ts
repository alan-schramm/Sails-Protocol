/**
 * VouchService — Sails OpenReputation
 * RFC-021 D7 (`docs/rfcs/RFC-021-market-based-arbitration-and-payment-trust.md`).
 *
 * The real bootstrap mechanism for two brand-new participants who would
 * otherwise both start at zero (Yuri's "handshake at Anarcapulco"
 * analogy) — a peer with real trade history vouches for a newcomer,
 * which pre-signs the newcomer's first `PaymentAccount`
 * (payment-account.service.ts's `getOrCreate()`), skipping
 * `UNSIGNED_TRADE_LIMIT` entirely.
 *
 * Explicitly NOT a KYC/identity-linking flow — corrected directly by the
 * project owner (2026-08-02) after an earlier, lazier reading of this
 * RFC's own D7 draft used that framing: this protocol does not do KYC.
 * A vouch is a protocol-native attestation between two keypairs, nothing
 * more — the voucher is not verifying the vouchee's real-world identity,
 * only staking their own reputation on "I'm willing to vouch for this
 * participant."
 *
 * Real skin in the game, not a free action: eligibility requires actual
 * trade history (MIN_VOUCHER_TRADES) and non-negative standing, and if
 * the vouchee's first lost dispute happens while the vouch is still
 * active, the voucher's own reputation takes a real, disclosed penalty
 * (reputation.service.ts's `penalizeForBurnedVouch()`) — the same
 * "reputation as slashable collateral" principle D3 already applies to
 * arbiters, extended one hop further out. This is what keeps two fresh
 * Sybil accounts from vouching for each other for free: a real,
 * established account has to put its own real standing at risk to
 * bootstrap a newcomer.
