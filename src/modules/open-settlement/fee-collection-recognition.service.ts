/**
 * FeeCollectionRecognitionService — Missão 11 Fase 5.
 *
 * Closes the gap between "the settlement transaction contains a real
 * Sails Protocol Fee output" and "the Sails accounting system has
 * recognized that fee as actually collected" (Fase 4.2's own Activation
 * Blocker A). Rail-agnostic by design — it only ever writes
 * FeeCollectionEvidence rows and drives FeeObligation.collectionStatus
 * through the existing Fase 2.1 transition graph
 * (PENDING_COLLECTION -> IN_PROGRESS -> COLLECTED, with COLLECTED ->
 * IN_PROGRESS as the one automatic backward edge, for a pre-distribution
 * reorg). Every rail-specific concern — deciding WHICH output is the fee,
 * querying a chain explorer for confirmation depth — lives in the calling
 * rail's own provider (multisig.provider.ts's identifyFeeOutput()/
 * fetchTransactionConfirmationStatus() for MULTISIG) and is never
 * duplicated here.
 *
 * The core invariant this service exists to enforce structurally:
 * NO ON-CHAIN COLLECTION EVIDENCE -> NO COLLECTED REVENUE. Every method
 * below either records real evidence tied to a real txid/output, or
 * refuses.

// two writes to commit atomically (see that method's own header comment
// for the adversarial proof of why), but this class's own established
// contract is unit-testable via fake repositories with NO real database
// (this file's own test suite's header comment). Hardcoding a call to the
// real `prisma.$transaction` would silently force every test through this
// method to open a genuine Postgres transaction — reproduced directly
// while building this fix (the existing fake-repo unit tests hung
// waiting on a real DB round trip). A single injectable function,
// defaulting to the real `prisma.$transaction`, keeps production
// behavior exactly atomic while letting a unit test supply a trivial
// synchronous-passthrough fake (`(fn) => fn(undefined)`) — the fake
// repositories underneath already ignore the `tx` argument entirely, so
// this changes nothing about what those tests actually verify.

   * Missão 11 Fase 7.2 (CTO-frozen decision) — this is also the ONLY
   * place a DistributionPolicyVersion is ever selected to govern a
   * collection generation's future allocation. Resolved once, right here.
   *
   * Missão 11 Fase 7.2.1 — the CONFIRMED-evidence insert (carrying the
   * resolved policy) and the IN_PROGRESS -> COLLECTED transition commit
   * inside ONE prisma.$transaction — the same pattern entitlement-
   * allocation.service.ts's own allocate() already established for this
   * identical class of problem ("reading/writing economically
   * authoritative state must not leave a crash-recoverable window where
   * one half committed and the other didn't"). Proven necessary by direct
   * adversarial reproduction against real Postgres: the previous shape
   * (two separate top-level writes) let a crash between them, followed by
   * the real periodic sweep job's automatic retry
   * (multisig-fee-confirmation-job.ts re-selects any still-IN_PROGRESS
   * obligation every tick — this is not a hypothetical race, it is that
   * job's normal, expected recovery behavior), produce TWO CONFIRMED rows
   * for the SAME on-chain confirmation event, independently frozen to
   * DIFFERENT DistributionPolicyVersions if a policy rotation happened in
   * that window. Wrapping both writes atomically closes this
   * structurally: either both commit (one fully-formed COLLECTED
   * generation with its one frozen policy) or neither does — a retry
   * starts genuinely fresh, with zero orphaned evidence row ever
   * persisted. The same atomic claim also closes the concurrent-caller
   * case (two simultaneous recognizeConfirmation() calls): the SECOND to
   * reach the transition claim inside its own transaction sees 0 rows
   * affected (the row's collectionStatus is no longer 'IN_PROGRESS' once
   * the first transaction commits) and throws, rolling back that
   * transaction's own CONFIRMED insert too — never leaving a second,
   * competing CONFIRMED row behind. Operational latency (a worker running
   * allocate() seconds, minutes, or a process-restart later) still can
   * never affect which policy this generation is bound to. A `null`
   * result (zero DistributionPolicyVersion PUBLISHED right now) is a
   * real, permanent outcome, not a placeholder — no backfill, no later
   * adoption of whatever becomes live afterward (Fase 7.2 §C).
