/**
 * EscrowFeeSnapshotService — Missão 11 Fase 2.2 (foundation) / Fase 4.1
 * (pre-funding waiver + fail-closed snapshot).
 *
 * computeSnapshotFields() is a PURE lookup+computation (one read, no
 * writes): given a rail and a trade notional, it decides — BEFORE any
 * funding has happened — whether a PUBLISHED policy exists for that rail
 * and, if so, whether the maximum possible Protocol Fee (Fmax, sized
 * against the full trade notional, the worst-case release basis) is even
 * economically collectible against the CURRENTLY configured collection
 * destination (Fase 4.1 §1). A seller must never be asked to pre-fund a
 * reserve that is already known, at this moment, to be uncollectible —
 * discovering that only at settlement time (Fase 4's own gap, closed
 * here) left a real class of escrows fundable-but-unreleasable.
 *
 * escrow.service.ts's createEscrow() calls this BEFORE creating the
 * escrow row and folds the result straight into that same INSERT — never
 * a separate best-effort update afterward. This is what makes the whole
 * operation fail-closed by construction (Fase 4.1 §4): if a PUBLISHED
 * policy exists for this rail and anything here throws, the escrow is
 * never created at all — there is no persistence step left to fail
 * independently, and therefore no way for a fee-aware escrow to end up
 * silently downgraded to a legacy (feePolicyVersionId=NULL) one because
 * of a DB hiccup. No active/published policy for the rail is the ONLY
 * case that returns null (normal no-fee behavior, unchanged).
 *
 * snapshotEscrowFeePolicy() (update-based) is kept for direct/isolated
 * testing against an ALREADY-existing escrow row (e.g. proving the
 * DB-native immutability trigger) — createEscrow() itself no longer uses
 * this path.
