/**
 * dispute-dispatch-recovery.ts — Sails Core Implementation Program M9-R
 * (Recovery Closure), Part 2. Closes crash window C4, found during the
 * M9 analytical gate: a dispute ruling can commit its durable,
 * Core-authoritative Outcome (`SemanticTransitionRecord`, via
 * `commitAuthoritativeDisputeRuling()`) and then the process can die
 * BEFORE `initiateRelease()`/`initiateRefund()`/`initiateSplit()` ever
 * persists the unsigned PSBT — leaving a RESOLVED Dispute with a
 * committed Outcome, a non-terminal escrow, and no
 * `EscrowPendingTransaction` row at all. Nothing in Mission11's own
 * reconciliation (`escrow-settlement-reconciliation.service.ts`, both
 * passes require a TERMINAL escrow) or M9's stale-pending cleanup
 * (`dispute-pending-reconciliation.ts`, requires an EXISTING pending
 * row) ever looks at this combination. `resolveDispute()`'s own top-level
 * guard (`dispute.status === 'RESOLVED'` -> reject) also means the
 * client cannot simply retry the original request.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO (mission's own explicit constraints):
 *   - Never re-runs discretionary authority. The arbiter does not sign
 *     again — `commitAuthoritativeDisputeRuling()`'s Ed25519 verification
 *     already happened once, durably, at ruling time; this module never
 *     calls it again and never asks for a new signature.
 *   - Never reinterprets the ruling. `record.outcome.content` (ruling,
 *     allocations, remainder) is loaded verbatim from the durably
 *     committed `SemanticTransitionRecord` — never re-derived from
 *     current request parameters (there is no current request).
 *   - Never re-resolves the beneficiary destination from CURRENT
 *     `PayoutAddress` state. `record.outcome.destinationBinding.reference`
 *     is the historical snapshot taken atomically at ruling-commit time
 *     (`dispute-outcome.ts`'s own `resolveBeneficiaryDestination()`); this
 *     module passes those values as the EXPLICIT address argument to
 *     `initiateRelease`/`initiateRefund`/`initiateSplit`, which (per
 *     `resolvePayoutAddress()`'s own `if (explicitAddress) return
 *     explicitAddress` short-circuit) means the current PayoutAddress
 *     table is never consulted for this dispatch.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES: reuses the EXACT same real entry points a live
 * ruling already uses (`escrowService.initiateRelease/Refund/Split`,
 * `assertDisputeDispatchEligible`, `assertTranslationMatchesOutcome`) —
 * this is "recovery is derived from facts," not a parallel dispatch
 * mechanism. The verb is RESUME_AUTHORIZED_DISPATCH: build the
 * previously-never-built PSBT from an authorization that was already,
 * durably, and independently verified — never RETRY_DISPUTE,
 * RE-RUN_AUTHORITY, or RE-RUN_RESOLVE_DISPUTE.
 *
 * DUPLICATE WORKERS: `initiateSignatureCollectionCore()` (escrow-pending-tx.ts)
 * already has a real, durable `@@unique(escrowId)` constraint on
 * `EscrowPendingTransaction`, enforced inside `withEscrowFundingLock()`'s
 * own `pg_advisory_xact_lock`. Two workers racing the same C4 escrow both
 * reach that same real write path; exactly one wins, the other gets a
 * `P2002` that `initiateSignatureCollectionCore()` converts into an
 * `EscrowError` ("...already has a pending transaction... (concurrent
 * initiate)"). This module treats that specific, recognizable error as a
 * benign "someone else already resumed this" outcome, never a failure —
 * no new locking primitive was invented; the existing one is reused.
 *
 * BOUNDED PASSES (M9-R bounded recovery): one invocation attempts at most
 * `limit` dispatches. The candidate predicate is evaluated in SQL, so
 * already-dispatched and legacy disputes are never loaded or re-checked
 * row by row. A candidate whose dispatch keeps failing (for example an
 * unreachable explorer, or a revoked capability grant) is still retried on
 * every sweep, but it can no longer make every pass do work proportional
 * to the whole failing backlog. Fair order comes from
 * `Dispute.dispatchRecoveryAttemptedAt`: see `claimCandidates()`.

/**
 * Candidate predicate: a RESOLVED Dispute on a MULTISIG escrow that is NOT
 * terminal, has NO surviving `EscrowPendingTransaction` row, and has a
 * durable Core-authoritative ruling record with an Outcome. This is the
 * durable fact combination C4 leaves behind — nothing else in this
 * codebase's own model can produce it except a crash in exactly that
 * window (a live, successful ruling always reaches at least the pending-
 * transaction write before returning to the caller). The predicate is the
 * same one the previous in-memory loop applied, now evaluated in SQL.
 *
 * Order is strict round-robin by queue key =
 * COALESCE(dispatchRecoveryAttemptedAt, resolvedAt, createdAt), ties
 * broken by id. Claiming a candidate stamps it in the same statement, which
 * moves it behind every candidate not attempted since. Starvation-free:
 * only candidates with a smaller key are ahead of a given one, that set is
 * finite, and each of them moves behind it once it is served. So every
 * candidate is attempted within ceil(ahead / limit) sweeps, however large
 * the history and however many other candidates keep failing. A crash
 * after the stamp commits costs one queue turn, never the candidate itself:
 * the stamp decides order only, and eligibility is re-derived below from
 * durable facts on every attempt. SKIP LOCKED gives two concurrent workers
 * disjoint batches while their claims overlap in time. It is not what
 * prevents duplicate dispatch; EscrowPendingTransaction's unique constraint
 * still is (see header).
