/**
 * expiry-shadow.ts — Sails Core Implementation Program, Phase 3
 * (M3 — First Shadow Semantic Slice: FUNDS_LOCKED -> EXPIRED).
 *
 * THIS MODULE IS STRUCTURALLY NON-AUTHORITATIVE. It exists to observe,
 * once per swept escrow, whether the Pure Core reference timelock
 * evaluator (`@sails/core`'s `sails-timelock-evaluator@1.0`) agrees
 * with the ALREADY-MADE legacy decision that an escrow's timelock has
 * elapsed — never to make or influence that decision.
 *
 * The legacy decision is made entirely by
 * `escrow-repository.ts`'s `findExpiredFundsLocked()`:
 *   `prisma.escrow.findMany({ where: { status: 'FUNDS_LOCKED', expiresAt: { lt: now } } })`
 * Every escrow this module ever sees was ALREADY selected by that
 * query before this module runs — nothing here re-decides membership
 * in that set, and nothing here can remove an escrow from it either.
 *
 * Hard boundary, enforced by what this module's exported functions
 * simply do not have the capability to do:
 *   - `isLegacyExpired` and `compareExpiryShadow` are pure: no Prisma
 *     import, no event bus, no Provider, no clock of their own.
 *   - `observeExpiryShadow` is the only impure function, and its only
 *     effect is a best-effort structured log line. It never throws
 *     past its own boundary, never returns a value the caller in
 *     `escrow.service.ts` uses for any control-flow decision, and its
 *     return value being ignored there is itself the mechanical
 *     evidence of non-authority: deleting the one call site that
 *     invokes it leaves every economic code path in
 *     `sweepExpiredEscrows()` byte-for-byte identical (verified in
 *     `tests/expiryShadow.test.ts`).
