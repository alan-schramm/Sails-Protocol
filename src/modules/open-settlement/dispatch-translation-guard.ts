/**
 * dispatch-translation-guard.ts — Sails Core Implementation Program
 * M8-R (Live Dispatch Retry), mission §18-19 (pre-dispatch translation
 * validation).
 *
 * BOUNDARY: this is Runtime/domain code, deliberately OUTSIDE
 * `packages/sails-core` — it decodes real Bitcoin PSBT bytes
 * (`bitcoinjs-lib`), which Pure Core must never do
 * (`docs/CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md` §8, M0's own mechanical boundary). It
 * exists to catch a buggy or malicious MULTISIG translator
 * (`multisig.provider.ts`'s `buildUnsignedRelease/Refund/Split()`,
 * UNCHANGED by this mission) BEFORE any signature is collected or
 * anything is broadcast — never a replacement for, and never reusing the
 * same code as, M6's POST-EXECUTION correspondence evaluator
 * (`destination-correspondence.ts`) or `sails-sdk`'s wallet-side
 * `verifySigningIntent()` (a REMOTE wallet's own independent input/
 * script verification against tampering in transit — a different threat
 * this server-side self-check does not need to duplicate, since the
 * server itself built the PSBT from its own trusted escrow record).
 *
 * WHY GROSS-TOTAL vs. NET-OF-FEE (see `economic-outcome.ts`'s own
 * `allocateExactUnitsOverTotal()` comment): the authoritative Outcome
 * commits to the ECONOMIC RULE (ruling + bps + the escrow's full locked
 * amount), never a pre-computed net-of-miner-fee sat amount — the real
 * miner fee is only known once the provider actually builds the PSBT
 * against live network fee-rate data. This guard re-derives the EXPECTED
 * per-beneficiary split against the REAL spendable total it decodes from
 * the PSBT itself (input value minus the REAL fee actually implied by
 * that PSBT's own outputs) — never trusting a provider-claimed fee
 * figure at face value for a MULTI-beneficiary (SPLIT) ruling: shifting
 * the ratio between two real, independent beneficiaries (e.g. "70/30
 * shifted to 60/40") is caught regardless of what fee is claimed, since
 * the RATIO check has nothing to do with the total.
 *
 * DISCLOSED LIMIT — SINGLE-BENEFICIARY RULINGS (RELEASE/REFUND): with
 * only one beneficiary, "100% of whatever is left after the fee" is
 * tautologically satisfied by any real output — a translator that
 * skims value by claiming an inflated-but-internally-consistent miner
 * fee cannot be caught by a pure ratio/destination check alone,
 * exactly the same disclosed gap `sails-sdk`'s own wallet-side
 * `verifySigningIntent()` already carries for a REMOTE wallet
 * (`ExpectedSigningIntent.feeRate`'s own comment: "informational only").
 * This guard closes the adjacent, genuinely catchable case instead: an
 * OPTIONAL `declaredMinerFeeSats` parameter (the provider's OWN
 * `buildUnsignedRelease/Refund/Split()` return value, already computed
 * before this guard runs) is checked for INTERNAL CONSISTENCY against
 * the REAL fee implied by the PSBT's own bytes — catching a translator
 * whose reported fee disagrees with what it actually built, a real bug
 * class distinct from, and not a substitute for, an external fee-rate
 * oracle this program does not build.
 *
 * SCOPE (disclosed, not silently assumed): this guard's "exactly the
 * authorized beneficiary set, no more, no less" output-count check
 * assumes the Sails Protocol Fee remains inactive (PROTOCOL_FEE_RATE has
 * never been raised above 0, `escrow-lifecycle.ts`'s own comment) — a
 * MULTISIG PSBT built today always has exactly one output per
 * beneficiary, never an additional fee-collection output. Mission M8-R
 * does not activate the fee (§39); if a future mission does, THIS guard
 * needs a corresponding, explicit extension — never a silent gap.
