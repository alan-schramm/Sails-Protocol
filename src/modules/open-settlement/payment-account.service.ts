 * PaymentAccountService — Sails OpenSettlement
 * RFC-021 D5 (`docs/rfcs/RFC-021-market-based-arbitration-and-payment-trust.md`).
 *
 * Real payment-account trust ramp, modeled on Bisq's actual "Payment
 * account age witness"/account signing (verified against Bisq's own
 * docs before writing this, not invented). A SEPARATE risk dimension
 * from `reputation.service.ts`'s `User.reputationScore`: this measures
 * whether a specific payment rail (a PIX key, a bank account) has
 * survived a completed trade without a chargeback — an otherwise
 * reputable trader's account can still be stolen/compromised, which is
 * exactly the "conta laranja" (mule account) risk trader reputation
 * alone does not cover.
 *
 * `signPaymentAccount()` deliberately reuses D1's narrow-attestation
 * framing (the same reasoning `market-arbitration.provider.ts`'s header
 * comment states for arbiters): the signer is attesting "this specific
 * trade completed without dispute," never "this person is trustworthy."
