/**
 * Sails OpenSettlement — Bitcoin dust/output policy (Missão 10, Fase 4)
 *
 * Real gap found auditing multisig.provider.ts's buildUnsignedSpend():
 * it guarded `spendableValue <= 0n` (input can't cover the fee) but had
 * NO check that an individual output actually clears Bitcoin's real
 * relay-policy dust threshold — a sub-dust output was fully buildable,
 * signable by both parties, and would only fail (if it failed at all)
 * at broadcast(), after both signatures were already collected.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a single magic constant (`DUST = 546`) applied
 * universally — that number is specifically the LEGACY P2PKH threshold;
 * a P2WPKH output's real threshold is 294, P2WSH/P2TR's is 330, under
 * Bitcoin Core's own default relay policy. `dustThresholdSats()` below
 * computes the threshold from the ACTUAL output script's serialized
 * size, mirroring Bitcoin Core's real `GetDustThreshold()`
 * (src/policy/policy.cpp) formula exactly — this generalizes correctly
 * to every standard script type Sails' payout-address surface can
 * currently produce (P2WPKH, P2WSH, P2TR, legacy P2PKH/P2SH), and to any
 * future witness version, without a per-type lookup table.
 *
 * Consensus vs. relay policy, precisely: Bitcoin's CONSENSUS rules do
 * not reject dust outputs at all — a block containing one is still
 * valid. Dust is purely a RELAY/mempool POLICY decision (every default-
 * configured node refuses to relay or mine a transaction with a
 * sub-dust output, governed by `-dustrelayfee`, default 3000 sat/kvB =
 * 3 sat/vB) — a real, separate node-operator-configurable knob, not a
 * protocol rule. Sails targets the REAL default relay policy every
 * standard node runs, since that's what determines whether a
 * broadcast() call in multisig.provider.ts actually succeeds.
 *
 * This dust-relay fee (3 sat/vB, a static relay-policy parameter) is
 * deliberately NOT the same value as fetchFeeRateSatsPerVByte()'s real
 * mempool.space-estimated rate (this specific transaction's own miner
 * fee) — conflating the two would be wrong: a transaction can legitimately
 * pay a much higher miner fee rate than the dust-relay floor, and dust
 * eligibility never depends on how much fee THIS transaction happens to
 * pay. Also deliberately unrelated to any Sails Protocol Fee (RFC-021 /
 * PROTOCOL_ECONOMY.md) — that is an entirely separate, currently-inert
 * (`PROTOCOL_FEE_RATE` defaults to 0) economic mechanism this mission
 * does not touch. Three genuinely independent concepts: miner fee, dust
 * threshold, protocol fee.
