/**
 * EntitlementAllocationService — Missão 11 Fase 6.3A economic accounting
 * foundation.
 *
 * Implements the one real, atomic operation this foundation exists for:
 * turning a COLLECTED FeeObligation into a durable, exact, append-only set
 * of recipient entitlements under the currently-live DistributionPolicyVersion
 * (allocate()), and reversing a generation's entitlements when a reorg
 * un-collects the revenue that backed it (reverse()).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wired into FeeCollectionRecognitionService.recognizeConfirmation()/
 * recordReorgAndRevert() automatically — same precedent as
 * FeeDistributionRepository.addObligationToBatch() (Fase 2.2), which has
 * zero real call sites outside its own tests today: a standalone,
 * explicitly-invokable capability, not auto-wired into the live collection
 * pipeline. Deciding WHEN allocation/reversal actually runs relative to
 * collection recognition is a payout-adjacent orchestration decision,
 * explicitly out of this phase's own "accounting foundation" scope
 * (Missão 11 Fase 6.3A §B's own exclusion list).
 *
 * allocate() runs its reads AND writes inside ONE prisma.$transaction —
 * mirroring FeeDistributionRepository.addObligationToBatch()'s own proven
 * pattern exactly (Fase 2.2): reading the obligation's live collectionStatus
 * and the live PUBLISHED policy INSIDE the same transaction as the write is
 * what closes the TOCTOU race a separate read-then-write sequence would
 * leave open — a concurrent reorg between the read and the write could
 * otherwise allocate against revenue that was reverted a moment earlier.

   * G12: fails closed unless a real frozen DistributionPolicyVersion
   *      exists for this generation — no implicit Treasury fallback
   *      (Phase 6.2 §D6/D7/D8).
   * G13: the confirmationEvidenceId used is the most recent CONFIRMED
   *      FeeCollectionEvidence row for this obligation — the DB trigger
   *      (entitlement_ledger_entries_confirmed_evidence_guard) independently
   *      re-verifies this is genuinely CONFIRMED before the insert commits.
   * G1-G4: exact Decimal arithmetic throughout; e_i = C × w_i/100; zero
   *      float; zero native-unit rounding; Σe_i = C exactly (proven by
   *      construction — see this method's own final assertion).
   * G5-G7: all entries for one generation are created in this one
   *      transaction; the policy reference and the evidence reference are
   *      both fixed to what this transaction itself resolved, never a
   *      value read outside it.
   * G9/G10: the @@unique([confirmationEvidenceId, recipientId, kind])
   *      constraint on entitlement_ledger_entries makes a retried or
   *      concurrent second attempt for the SAME generation fail at the
   *      database (P2002) — this method surfaces that as a clear,
   *      idempotent-safe EscrowError, never a silent double-write.
   *
   * Missão 11 Fase 7.2 (CTO-frozen decision) — this method NEVER chooses a
   * DistributionPolicyVersion from live PUBLISHED state (no findLivePolicy(),
   * no orderBy publishedAt, no take:1, no latest-wins). Distribution-policy
   * SELECTION belongs exclusively to recognition/COLLECTED time
   * (fee-collection-recognition.service.ts's recognizeConfirmation(),
   * which already froze it onto the CONFIRMED FeeCollectionEvidence row
   * this method reads). allocate() only MATERIALIZES the already-decided
   * economic ownership — reading the frozen reference is the entire
   * "selection" this method performs. Generation identity: the existing
   * "most recent CONFIRMED row for this obligation" query below already
   * disambiguates G1 vs. G2 correctly after a reorg/reconfirmation — a
   * fresh CONFIRMED row IS a new generation with its own independently
   * frozen policy reference, so no separate CollectionGeneration concept
   * is needed (Fase 7.2 §G).
