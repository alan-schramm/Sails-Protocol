/**
 * EscrowRepository — Sails OpenSettlement Component
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_REPORT.md recommendation #3, step 4 (final step) of
 * the incremental rollout (step 1: CapabilityGrantRepository, step 2:
 * IntentRepository, step 3: TradeRepository). Real fund-moving code
 * (Bitcoin multisig / EVM Safe-guard settlement) — every method here is
 * a verbatim 1:1 move of an existing Prisma call, no behavior change.
 *
 * Scope, deliberately narrow: wraps `prisma.escrow.*` only, plus one
 * bundled-in read no other repository owns — findDisputeByTradeAndArbiter()
 * (isSellerOrAssignedArbiter()'s fallback check) — same "bundle in the
 * one extra read a consumer needs" precedent TradeRepository already set
 * with findOfferById(). Escrow's own satellite/child tables
 * (escrowParticipantKey, escrowEvent, feeDistribution,
 * escrowReleaseApproval, escrowPendingTransaction,
 * escrowTransactionSignature) are deliberately NOT wrapped here — they're
 * already fully confined to open-settlement's own files (never a
 * cross-module violation, the actual problem this rollout exists to
 * fix), so including them would roughly double this step's size without
 * closing any new architectural violation. Deferred, disclosed, not
 * silently dropped.
 *
 * claimTransition() returns the raw affected-row count — no EscrowError/
 * VALID_TRANSITIONS logic lives here. Both stay exactly where they are
 * today: escrow-lifecycle.ts's claimEscrowTransition() keeps its own
 * VALID_TRANSITIONS pre-check + throw; escrow.service.ts's
 * markPaymentSent() keeps its own separate, pre-existing, undeduplicated
 * throw (it never had the VALID_TRANSITIONS gate — this pass does not
 * add one as a side effect of moving the persistence call). Mirrors
 * IntentRepository.claimTransition()'s own precedent exactly.
