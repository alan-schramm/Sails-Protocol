/**
 * dispute-pending-reconciliation.ts — Sails Core Implementation Program
 * M9 (Recovery, Execution Uncertainty & Semantic Reconciliation).
 *
 * Closes the ONE concrete, disclosed residual M8-R and M8.6 both carried
 * forward without solving: "crash between unsigned PSBT persistence and
 * translation-guard cleanup may leave a stale pending row" (M8-R's own
 * finding, mission M9 §40's explicit instruction to revisit it).
 *
 * SCOPE — narrowly the M8-R Core-authoritative MULTISIG dispute-ruling
 * slice only, matching this whole program's own discipline: a pending
 * transaction this module ever touches must (a) belong to a MULTISIG
 * escrow, (b) belong to an escrow with a RESOLVED Dispute (the durable
 * signal that `applyRulingCoreAuthoritative()`'s own commit path, not
 * some other flow, is what created it), and (c) have ZERO signatures
 * collected — the durable, checkable fact that makes deletion
 * unconditionally safe: `escrow-pending-tx.ts`'s own
 * `submitTransactionSignature()` is the ONLY code path that can ever
 * move funds for a signature-collection escrow, and it structurally
 * cannot have run yet if no required signer has submitted anything.
 *
 * WHY RE-RUNNING THE GUARD IS SAFE AND CONCLUSIVE (never a guess): the
 * translation guard (`dispatch-translation-guard.ts`,
 * `assertTranslationMatchesOutcome()`) is a PURE, deterministic function
 * of two IMMUTABLE inputs — the stored `unsignedPsbtBase64` bytes (never
 * mutated once persisted) and the durable, historical Outcome
 * (`SemanticTransitionRecord`, also immutable once committed, per this
 * program's own Rule 3: "a committed Record is never edited"). Whatever
 * verdict the guard would have produced at persist time, it produces
 * again now — there is no "staleness" in the sense of the ANSWER
 * changing, only in the sense of the CLEANUP never having run. A
 * surviving pending row is therefore in exactly one of two states,
 * distinguishable by re-running the SAME check:
 *   1. The guard was never reached (crash before it ran) — re-running it
 *      now gives the definitive, first-ever verdict.
 *   2. The guard ran, FAILED, and its own cleanup delete crashed before
 *      completing — re-running it now deterministically fails again,
 *      confirming deletion is (still) correct.
 * A row whose guard verdict is a PASS is not stale at all — it is a
 * legitimate pending transaction genuinely still awaiting signature
 * collection (mission §27's own "prepared but never executed... may
 * resume automatically" — sufficient evidence exists here precisely
 * because the deterministic re-check IS that evidence).
