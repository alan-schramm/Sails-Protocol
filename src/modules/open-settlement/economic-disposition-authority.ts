/**
 * ADR-005 / #218 — Economic Disposition Commit Gate.
 *
 * Closes the gap ADR-004's Execution Commit Gate (capability-execution-
 * authorization.ts) deliberately does not cover: a technically valid,
 * fully-signed pending transaction can still be attributable to a ruling
 * generation the Dispute has since moved past (appeal/reassignment). ADR-004
 * proves the ORIGINAL initiator still has Capability/Eligibility Authority.
 * This module proves the pending operation's recorded Economic Disposition
 * Authority — the ruling generation that actually authorized its economic
 * disposition — is still the dispute's current authoritative generation.
 * Neither gate substitutes for the other (ADR-005 §7).
 *
 * Immediately before the first provider side effect:
 *   1) serializes with appeal() and the disputed-ruling resolve-write in
 *      Postgres, on the same `economic-disposition:<disputeId>` lock scope
 *      ADR-005 §3 names;
 *   2) re-loads the LIVE Dispute row (never trusts transient request
 *      memory) and compares it against the generation snapshotted on the
 *      pending operation at creation time (escrow-pending-tx.ts's
 *      initiateSignatureCollectionCore());
 *   3) fails closed if the dispute has moved to a different generation;
 *   4) otherwise durably commits economic-disposition execution
 *      authorization before returning.
 *
 * A retry for the exact same immutable pending operation reuses that durable
 * authorization and does NOT re-validate against the (possibly by-then-
 * superseded) live dispute state — ADR-005 §4/§5E: "later appeal/revocation
 * is prospective with respect to an already committed execution attempt."
 *
 * CTO Gate R1 (#222) finding 1 — absence of recorded provenance
 * (`disputeId: null`) does NOT by itself prove a cooperative origin. It is
 * true both for a genuinely cooperative pending operation and for a legacy
 * row created before this migration shipped (which may itself have been a
 * disputed-ruling settlement action, just never recorded as one). The two
 * are distinguished here by an independent, already-durable fact this
 * module does not fabricate: whether ANY Dispute row exists at all for this
 * escrow. `Dispute` is effectively one-per-trade for its entire lifetime
 * (schema.prisma's own `@@unique([tradeId])` comment: "no reopen-after-
 * RESOLVED path... one Dispute per Trade for its entire lifetime") — so "no
 * Dispute row exists for this escrow" is a durable, provable fact that this
 * escrow's trade was NEVER disputed, at any point, which makes every pending
 * operation on it provably cooperative. Any escrow that WAS ever disputed
 * keeps that Dispute row forever, even after resolution — so its presence
 * alone (regardless of current status) is enough to make a disputeId-null
 * pending row on that escrow ambiguous, not provably cooperative, and this
 * gate fails it closed rather than guessing.
 *
 * No fabricated provenance: a row is never promoted to "provenance
 * verified" by inference — either it durably carries the full recorded
 * generation (the normal gate path below), or its escrow is durably proven
 * to have never had a Dispute at all (the fast-path below), or it is
 * rejected. `UNKNOWN provenance ≠ cooperative provenance`.
