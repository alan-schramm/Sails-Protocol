/**
 * dispute-outcome.ts — Sails Core Implementation Program M8-R (Live
 * Dispatch Retry). The Runtime orchestration that makes Mission13's
 * MULTISIG disputed-settlement path Core-authoritative: composes M5
 * Attribution + M7 Outcome + M8.5 Destination Snapshot into one durable,
 * atomically-committed `SemanticTransitionRecord` — BEFORE `dispute.service.ts`'s
 * `applyRuling()` is allowed to call any settlement action.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `semantic-transition-record.ts`
 * (M3.5/M4): that file's `commitAuthoritativeEscrowTimelockExpiry()` and
 * `EscrowTimelockExpiryPayload` are hard-coded to a deterministic,
 * non-repeatable, non-outcome-bearing transition (`fromState`/`toState`/
 * `deadlineMs`/`evaluationTimeMs`, throwing if `attribution`/`outcome`
 * are ever present). Mission13 dispute ruling is a genuinely different
 * decision class — K2 (discretionary) AND K3 (outcome-bearing), and
 * legitimately REPEATABLE per escrow across appeal rounds — so it gets
 * its own persistence-mapping function alongside the existing one
 * (`toDisputeRulingTransitionRecordRow`, not a parametrized reuse of
 * `toSemanticTransitionRecordRow`), per this program's own established
 * "add a new one, when the scope is genuinely different" discipline.
 * Both write to the SAME `semantic_transition_records` table — the K2/K3
 * columns that table's own schema comment already reserved for exactly
 * this future slice.
 *
 * ATOMICITY BOUNDARY (mission §13): this module's own transaction is the
 * ENTIRE semantic commit — Dispute.status: * -> RESOLVED (plus the
 * signed-decision bookkeeping fields dispute.service.ts previously wrote
 * separately) AND the SemanticTransitionRecord insert commit together,
 * or neither does. `dispute.service.ts`'s EXISTING revert-on-failure
 * block (if the LATER, non-transactional settlement-action call fails)
 * is extended to also delete the just-committed record — see that
 * file's own comment for why a reverted ruling must never leave a
 * dangling Core authorization behind.
 *
 * DESTINATION SNAPSHOT (mission §8-9, docs/DESTINATION_AUTHORITY_ARCHITECTURE.md
 * §6): resolved via the SAME transactional client (`tx.payoutAddress.findUnique`)
 * used for the Dispute claim and the Record insert — never a plain
 * SELECT before the transaction begins. See this file's own
 * `resolveBeneficiaryDestination()` for the exact deterministic-race
 * reasoning (no advisory lock needed here — unlike
 * `withEscrowFundingLock()`'s genuine read-then-write TOCTOU gap across
 * multiple tables, this is a pure read of a row this transaction never
 * writes to, so Postgres's own READ COMMITTED MVCC snapshot already
 * gives a real, deterministic happens-before relationship against any
 * concurrent PayoutAddress mutation — proven in
 * tests/integration/disputeOutcomeDestinationSnapshot.test.ts).
 *
 * NO FABRICATED PROVENANCE (Decision 4, M8.5 §14): a beneficiary with no
 * registered PayoutAddress fails this transaction closed — the caller
 * gets the SAME clear error `escrow-lifecycle.ts`'s `resolvePayoutAddress()`
 * already produces for "no address, none registered," never a
 * caller-supplied or profile-mutation fallback.
