/**
 * settlement-recovery-schedule.ts — the production tick for settlement crash
 * recovery (Issue #291/#298 hardening), started by app.ts's startServer()
 * when config.features.escrowSettlementReconciler is on (the default).
 *
 * One tick runs, in order:
 *   1. reconcilePendingSettlements() — terminal escrows missing a result,
 *      completion effects or projections (PASS 0-3).
 *   2. reconcileMissingDispatch() — M9-R/C4: a dispute ruling committed
 *      durably but the process died before the payout PSBT was persisted.
 *      Same class of work as step 1 (finishing an already-authorised
 *      settlement a crash left half done, never a new disposition), which is
 *      why it shares this tick instead of getting its own scheduler.
 *
 * Each step's failure is logged and contained; step 1 failing never skips
 * step 2. One tick makes ONE reconcileMissingDispatch() call with its
 * default bound (DISPATCH_RECOVERY_BATCH), never a catch-up loop: a backlog
 * is worked through across ticks, fairly (see dispute-dispatch-recovery.ts).
 *
 * A tick never starts while the previous one in this process is still
 * running (a pass can take minutes during an explorer outage), so the
 * number of concurrent invocations per process is at most one. That flag is
 * operational only. Correctness across ticks, restarts and instances comes
 * from PostgreSQL: the write-once/idempotent passes of step 1 and, for step
 * 2, EscrowPendingTransaction's @@unique(escrowId) plus the durable
 * round-robin stamp. Several instances may run this tick concurrently.
