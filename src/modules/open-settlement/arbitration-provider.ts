/**
 * ArbitrationProvider — Sails OpenSettlement Adapter
 * RFC-007 (rfcs/RFC-007-real-world-p2p-requirements.md), decision D4.
 *
 * Specified in RFC-007 but never implemented (BACKLOG.md: 🔲 Not started)
 * until now (04-Deepseek Review.md's raiseDispute() task). Deliberately
 * not called "Guardian" or any protocol-native role — RFC-007's own
 * reasoning: the protocol defines the interface, each application
 * registers its own Trusted Arbitrators, the protocol itself never
 * arbitrates or claims authority over the outcome.
 *
 * Unlike RedisStreamsEventStore/StubLightsparkClient, this ships as a
 * real, working implementation — `assign()` is simple, local,
 * deterministic logic with no external dependency to verify against, not
 * an unverifiable third-party API call.
 *
 * Refined from RFC-007 D4's original interface: that RFC's `rule()`
 * signature (`rule(disputeId, arbiterId): Promise<Dispute['ruling']>`)
 * implied the provider computes a ruling — but a Trusted Arbitrator's
 * ruling is a human decision, an external input, not something this
 * provider can compute. `rule()` is dropped; `dispute.service.ts`'s
 * `resolveDispute()` is the real entry point for an arbiter's decision,
 * taking `ruling` as a parameter rather than deriving it.
