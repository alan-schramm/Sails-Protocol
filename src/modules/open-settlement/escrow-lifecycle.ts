// the sweep's own recovery path already prevents permanent fund denial —
// but the race itself, a lifecycle transition succeeding on
// assertFundingNotUncertain()'s now-stale result because a concurrent
// sweep tick invalidated the same evidence a moment later, was real).
//
// assertFundingNotUncertain() above is a cheap, unlocked, EARLY fail-fast
// only — it saves wasted work (trade lookups, authorization checks,
// PSBT construction) when the escrow is already known-bad, but a
// separate read followed later by a separate write is exactly a TOCTOU
// window: the sweep (multisig-funding-reorg-sweep.ts) can invalidate the
// evidence in between. This helper closes that window by making the
// AUTHORITATIVE re-check and the state-changing write atomic with
// respect to any concurrent evidence write, using the exact same
// pg_advisory_xact_lock pattern already shipped and tested for
// correlationId-scoped event-append serialization
// (src/common/events/event-store.ts's PostgresEventStore.publish()) —
// applied here with escrowId as the lock key instead.
//
// Why this closes the race: whichever writer (a lifecycle transition via
// this helper, or the sweep via its own use of this same helper) acquires
// the advisory lock first for a given escrowId completes its ENTIRE
// read-then-write sequence — inside one Postgres transaction — before the
// other side can even acquire the lock. There is no window in which one
// side's write can land between the other side's read and write, because
// both sides' read-then-write is now one atomic unit under the same key.
//
// Why pg_advisory_xact_lock specifically (mirrors event-store.ts's own
// documented reasoning exactly): (a) it lives in Postgres itself, so it
// serializes every writer across every app instance/process, not just
// within one process's memory — a plain in-process Map<id, Promise> mutex
// would NOT serialize two separate server instances, which this system
// must support; (b) the `_xact_` variant auto-releases at transaction end
// (commit OR rollback), so a crashed request or thrown error can never
// leak a held lock — no explicit unlock call needed, restart-safe by
// construction; (c) hashtext() converts escrowId (a string) into the
// bigint Postgres advisory locks require, with the same disclosed,
// accepted, harmless caveat event-store.ts's own comment already
// documents: two different escrowIds could theoretically hash-collide
// and briefly contend for the lock (extra serialization, never a
// wrong-key collision — the WHERE/read predicates inside fn() are always
// scoped by the real escrowId, never by the hash).
//
// Different escrowIds never contend with each other (proven by the
// adversarial "two workers, different escrows" test) — this is
// deliberately NOT a global lock, matching the CTO's explicit
