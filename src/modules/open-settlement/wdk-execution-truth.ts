/**
 * wdk-execution-truth.ts — Bounded Remediation (WDK Fund-Moving Safety,
 * 2026-09-08), closing the retry-safety gaps
 * docs/WDK_UNKNOWN_OUTCOME_RETRY_SAFETY.md (#56) and
 * docs/WDK_FUND_MOVING_OPERATIONS_SAFETY.md (#58) demonstrated for
 * WDK_USDT_EVM's lockFunds()/releaseFunds()/refundFunds()/splitFunds().
 *
 * Properties this file exists to satisfy (full reasoning in the two docs
 * above, not re-derived here):
 *   A — Durable Operation Truth: identity for a logical economic
 *       operation is persisted BEFORE the external submission, not
 *       merely inferred from Escrow.status afterward.
 *   B — Unknown Outcome Safety: a call whose outcome is genuinely
 *       ambiguous (submitted, response lost) must not become blindly
 *       retryable — ensureAttempt() below refuses a second submission
 *       and requires reconciliation (a receipt check, if a hash exists)
 *       or manual intervention (if it doesn't).
 *   C — Submission != Confirmation: waitForReceiptOutcome() below never
 *       reports success on a bare returned hash — only on a real,
 *       queried receipt with status 1.
 *
 * Deliberately WDK-specific — this module is imported ONLY by
 * wdk-settlement.provider.ts. It is not a generic cross-rail primitive:
 * MULTISIG/LIGHTNING_HODL/SAFE_GUARD_EVM's own release/refund/split
 * paths are client-signature-collection or read-only verification, not
 * self-initiated custodial transfers, so they have no equivalent need
 * (docs/WDK_FUND_MOVING_OPERATIONS_SAFETY.md §10).
 *
 * Escrow.status (the semantic escrow lifecycle) is deliberately left
 * untouched by this file — this is a separate, lower-level truth layer
 * underneath it (Fase 10's own architectural preference). A caller whose
 * attempt is blocked here sees a thrown EscrowError; escrow.service.ts's
 * own existing claim/revert logic is unmodified and still runs exactly
 * as before — the real safety property (no second on-chain transfer for
 * one logical operation) is enforced HERE, before WalletAccountEvm.transfer()
 * is ever called again, regardless of what Escrow.status says.
 *
 * CTO Gate Correction (2026-09-08) — closing the PREPARED -> transfer() ->
 * SUBMITTED crash window. The original version of this file only wrote
 * SUBMISSION_UNKNOWN from inside a catch block, AFTER transfer() had
 * already thrown — meaning a crash DURING the transfer() call itself
 * (after a real broadcast may already have occurred, before the JS
 * promise ever settles) left the row at PREPARED, and the original
 * ensureAttempt() treated PREPARED as unconditionally safe to reuse. That
 * was wrong: PREPARED alone never proved transfer() hadn't been called —
 * it only proved the LAST write this row received was "identity
 * recorded." markSubmissionAttempted() below is now called by
 * wdk-settlement.provider.ts's executeTransfer() immediately BEFORE
 * transfer() — a durable, conservative pre-commit that the submission
 * boundary may be crossed. A crash at any point from that write onward
 * (including mid-transfer(), after a real broadcast) now leaves the row
 * at SUBMISSION_UNKNOWN, which this file's own SUBMISSION_UNKNOWN branch
 * already blocks unconditionally — no further change was needed there.
 * PREPARED now only persists if the crash happened strictly between
 * ensureAttempt() returning and that immediately-next, synchronous
 * pre-commit write (no intervening `await` in between other than the
 * pre-commit call itself) — a real, disclosed, but now minimal residual
 * window (see docs/WDK_UNKNOWN_OUTCOME_RETRY_SAFETY.md §22's own updated
 * residual list), not eliminated by construction (that would require a
 * distributed/2PC mechanism this mission does not authorize).
