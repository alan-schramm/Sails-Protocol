/**
 * Sails OpenSettlement — settlement crash-recovery reconciliation
 * (Missão 11 Fase 9.6, closes Kimi K3 R2's CONC-03, independently
 * confirmed CONFIRMED/P1 during Fase 9.5's triage; extended Missão 11
 * Fase 9.7 to close the "C5" gap the Fase 9.6 report explicitly
 * disclosed rather than silently claimed closed).
 *
 * Two structurally different gaps, two passes:
 *
 * PASS 1 (Fase 9.6) — "did the real fund movement happen at all?"
 * escrow.service.ts's releaseFunds()/refundFunds()/splitFunds() and
 * escrow-pending-tx.ts's submitTransactionSignature() all claim a
 * TERMINAL escrow status BEFORE the real settlement provider call, and
 * only persist `txReleaseId` AFTER it returns. A crash in that window
 * leaves txReleaseId null with no way to know whether the fund movement
 * itself already happened (Estado B) or never did (Estado A) — CTO's
 * own "Regra Zero": never guess. reconcileTxReleaseId() below asks the
 * chain, for MULTISIG only (the only rail with an authoritative,
 * independently-queryable truth source — see multisig.provider.ts's
 * reconcilePendingSettlement()). Every other rail fails closed.
 *
 * PASS 2 (Fase 9.7) — "the fund movement is CONFIRMED (txReleaseId is
 * already set) — did the DOWNSTREAM completion effects (fee obligation,
 * Trade.status, reputation, volume, the settlement.escrow.* event)
 * actually run?" A crash between txReleaseId persistence and
 * emitEscrowTransition() succeeding leaves those effects silently
 * missing — not duplicated, MISSING (Fase 9.7's own audit found several
 * of them — recordTradeCompletion()'s totalTrades/totalVolumeBtc
 * increments, reputationService.recordOutcome()'s reputationScore
 * increment — have no idempotency key of their own, so a NAIVE re-run
 * would risk double-counting; a MISSING run just silently leaves stats
 * wrong forever). This gap is NOT rail-specific — once txReleaseId is
 * confirmed, no further on-chain truth-seeking is needed for ANY rail,
 * only the SAME downstream chain every rail's own normal completion
 * path already runs. reconcileMissingCompletionEffects() below handles
 * this for every rail, gated by emitEscrowTransition()'s own new
 * (escrowId, toStatus) idempotency claim (escrow-lifecycle.ts, Fase
 * 9.7) — the single authoritative "has this already run" signal, not a
 * second one invented here.
 *
 * CTO's own explicit principle for Fase 9.7: not exactly-once delivery
 * — idempotent effects + at-least-once execution + observable
 * convergence, where technically appropriate. That's exactly what both
 * passes now provide: PASS 1 never broadcasts a second real Bitcoin
 * transaction (verified against chain truth first); PASS 2 never
 * double-applies a downstream effect (gated by emitEscrowTransition()'s
 * own atomic per-transition claim) and safely catches up a missing one.
