 * The result of asking "what is this offer identity's CURRENT

 * Deliberately NOT just "a row or null" — a single, unconditionally-
 * winning "latest" row cannot express owner equivocation without either
 * (a) silently picking an arbitrary winner (the exact defect this
 * correction closes) or (b) hiding that a conflict exists. `RESOLVED` is
 * the normal case; `EQUIVOCATED` means the owner produced two-or-more
 * genuinely different signed envelopes at the identical, currently-
 * highest revision for this identity — every conflicting row is
 * returned, and NONE of them should be treated as economically
 * authoritative until a later, unambiguous revision arrives (see
 * `getLatest()` below).
 *
 * **Scope, precise (CTO Gate correction 2026-09-09, Sixth Pass):** this
 * answers the CURRENT-STATE question only — "what is economically
 * active right now." It is NOT the historical signed-fact set (that is
 * simply every row this table holds for the identity, queried directly
 * — see Property P) and it is NOT a complete equivocation-history
 * report (a past, superseded revision can also have been equivocated;
 * `getLatest()` only surfaces equivocation at the CURRENT highest
 * revision, since only that revision affects current economic state).
 * These three questions are answered separately on purpose, per the
 * Sixth Pass mission's own instruction not to force them into one
 * verdict.

   * below). What `ingest()` still guards against: malformed/invalid
   * envelopes (`verifyOfferEnvelope()`), and duplicate storage of a fact
   * this node already has (Properties M/O below).
   *
   * **CTO Gate correction (2026-09-09), Sixth Pass, Property M —
   * concurrent identical-fact ingestion.** Reproduced directly against
   * real Postgres, before this fix: two concurrent `ingest(E1)` calls
   * (`Promise.all`) for the exact same signed envelope — both read
   * "no existing row" (a real TOCTOU race: neither write had landed yet
   * when either read happened), both attempted `create()`; the DB's own
   * unique constraint let exactly one succeed and threw a raw, uncaught
   * `PrismaClientKnownRequestError` (P2002) out of the SECOND caller's
   * `ingest()` call — an unhandled exception, not a graceful result.
   * Forbidden outcome, confirmed exactly as named. Fixed by relying on
   * the database's own ATOMIC uniqueness check as the actual
   * concurrency control (no global lock, no serialization — both
   * explicitly out of scope): `create()` is attempted directly, and a
   * P2002 on this table's own uniqueness constraint is caught and
   * converted into the identical graceful "already known, here is its
   * id" result the non-racing caller would have received from a
   * pre-check. Concurrent identical-fact ingestion is now idempotent:
   * one stored row, both callers receive an `accepted: true` result.
   *
   * **CTO Gate correction (2026-09-09), Sixth Pass, Property O —
   * `signature` is not a sound identity.** Confirmed directly (a
   * controlled test against the real `tweetnacl` verifier, not a guess):
   * given one valid Ed25519 signature `(R, S)` over a message, the
   * byte-different signature `(R, S + L)` (where `L` is the Ed25519
   * group order, `2^252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493`) also
   * verifies successfully against the identical message and public key
   * — with NO knowledge of the secret key required (classic Ed25519
   * signature malleability; `tweetnacl`'s verifier does not reject a
   * non-canonical `S`). Consequence: the Fifth Pass's own "different
   * signature at the same revision means equivocation" rule was
   * exploitable by a mere OBSERVER (not even the offer's owner) —
   * anyone who has seen one valid envelope can derive a second, valid,
   * byte-different signature over the IDENTICAL content and inject it,
   * falsely triggering `EQUIVOCATED` (a fail-closed, economically-inert
   * state) as a griefing vector against an offer the owner never
   * actually double-signed. Fixed: fact identity is now `contentDigest`
   * — `hashOfferEnvelope()`'s sha256 hex digest of the canonical
   * serialization, a pure function of the signed CONTENT fields only,
   * excluding `signature` — used both for the DB uniqueness constraint
   * (`prisma/schema.prisma`) and for `getLatest()`'s distinctness check
   * below. `signature` remains stored in full and is still what
   * `verifyOfferEnvelope()` re-checks on every call — it is demoted from
   * "identity" to "authorization evidence," never removed.
   *
   * **CTO Gate correction (2026-09-09, Sixth Pass, Property P —
   * historical-evidence convergence).** Reproduced directly: "History A"
   * (E1 rev5, E2 rev5, then rev6) and "History B" (rev6 arrives FIRST,
   * then E1 rev5, then E2 rev5) both eventually see the identical three
   * signed facts, and both converge on the identical CURRENT state
   * (rev6) — but, under the Fifth Pass's own "revision < highest is
   * stale, reject" rule, History B's own E1/E2 (arriving after rev6 was
   * already known) would have been rejected outright as stale, so
   * History B would end up with ZERO evidence that this owner ever
   * equivocated, while History A retains both rev5 rows — **the
   * historical-fact set and equivocation evidence a node ends up
   * holding depended on arrival order**, even though current-state
   * selection did not. Decision, evaluated explicitly (property first,
   * mechanism second): **Option B — all valid signed facts are
   * retained as historical/equivocation evidence, regardless of whether
   * their revision is lower than one already known.** Rejected Option A
   * (drop stale facts, document that absence of local equivocation
   * evidence proves nothing) because: reputation/abuse/dispute evidence
   * is a named ADR-001 concern this protocol already cares about, and
   * losing it purely as an artifact of arrival order undermines that for
   * free; storage/bandwidth cost is bounded by the number of genuinely
   * DISTINCT valid facts the true owner ever signed (an attacker without
   * the owner's key cannot manufacture new ones — cryptography, not
   * storage policy, is what already bounds this; Property O's own
   * content-digest-based idempotency separately bounds REPLAY of an
   * already-known fact to zero additional storage); replay-abuse
   * resistance is unaffected either way (replaying an already-stored
   * fact is idempotent under both options); this remains local
   * persistence only (no gossip/bandwidth relaying implemented in step
   * (a) at all); and implementing Option B costs LESS code than Option
   * A here, not more — it is the absence of a special case ("if this
   * revision is lower than the current highest, reject before storing"),
   * not an added one. Implemented as the minimum step (a) requires: the
   * `revision < highest → reject` branch is removed; storage and
   * equivocation-detection apply uniformly to every valid envelope
   * regardless of its revision relative to whatever else is already
   * known. `getLatest()`'s CURRENT-STATE semantics are completely
   * unchanged by this — it already only ever looks at the actual
   * highest revision present in storage, independent of insertion
   * order.
