/**
 * Sails OpenProof — Reference Implementation (PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md
 * §1.8, RFC-006). Fase 1 Task 3(c): built as the real feature this
 * security review's "QVAC forgery" task actually needed underneath it —
 * there was no OpenProof service layer at all to test against before
 * this file existed (interfaces only, `docs/whitepapers/TECHNICAL_WHITEPAPER.md`'s
 * own 🟡 label). Scope, stated precisely: `Claim → Proof → Verification`
 * plus the three security properties this pass exists to close (hash
 * recompute, nonce anti-replay, time-lock).
 *
 * **Closed 2026-08-04:** RFC-007's `ProofRegistry` (`proof-registry.ts`,
 * duplicate-evidence detection — exact-content only, see that file's own
 * disclosed limitation on perceptual hashing), `EvidenceProvider`
 * (`evidence-provider.ts`, real external media storage — `evidence` on
 * `Proof` itself still stores small/structured claims inline, the same
 * pragmatic choice `Message.content` already makes; `attachEvidence()`
 * below is the new path for actual media bytes), and RFC-008's
 * `AnchorProof`/`TimestampAnchor` (`timestamp-anchor.ts`, real submission
 * to a live OpenTimestamps calendar server — verification/upgrade is a
 * disclosed, separate gap, see that file's own header comment).

// Issue #261 — the canonical, single authorization boundary for every
// OpenProof operation that references a Claim's economic scope (claim
// creation, proof submission, evidence attachment, verification nonce
// issuance, proof verification, claim-scoped bundle read, evidence
// anchoring). Lives HERE, at the service layer every one of those
// methods already funnels through unconditionally — not at
// proof.routes.ts — so a direct service call (a test, a future
// automation caller, a different route) cannot bypass it the way a
// route-only `if (buyer || seller)` check could.
//
// Authentication ≠ Evidence Authorization: requireAuth (proof.routes.ts)
// only proves `actorId` is a real, currently-logged-in Participant. It
// proves nothing about whether that Participant has any relationship to
// THIS Claim's trade. This function is what closes that gap.
//
// Authority sources, in the order checked (mirrors #220's own findings
// and the mission's explicit list of legitimate sources):
//   1. Trade-bound Claim (claim.tradeId set) → the trade's buyer or
//      seller (tradeService.assertParticipant() — the SAME function
//      already used, and already accepted as correct, for the
//      trade-scoped bundle route's own precedent), OR the trade's
//      CURRENT assigned arbiter. "Current," not "ever assigned": a
//      Dispute row's `arbiterId` is the SAME field RFC-021 D6's appeal
//      flow overwrites in place (the superseded arbiter's id moves to
//      `previousArbiterId` on that same row — no second row is ever
//      created), so this query can never match a replaced arbiter.
//      Past Authority ≠ Current Authority is preserved by construction,
//      not by an extra check.
//   2. Non-trade Claim (claim.tradeId null) — RFC-007 D6's own comment
//      confirms this is a legitimate, supported shape, so it is
//      deliberately NOT prohibited here. But no trade-participant or
//      arbiter relationship exists to check for one, and inventing a
//      broader rule (e.g. "any authenticated Participant") would be
//      exactly the "global authenticated access" the mission forbids.
//      The one relationship that DOES already exist for a non-trade
//      Claim is authorship — Claim.claimedBy. This is the narrowest,
//      most defensible non-invented boundary: only the Claim's own
//      creator has authority over a Claim with no trade to anchor a
//      wider one to. See this mission's own return report for why this
//      is flagged as a real, reported ambiguity for verifyProof()
//      specifically (self-verification is a strange fit for a
//      Verification's own purpose) rather than silently resolved wider.

// in `prisma/schema.prisma`. This function is the executable form of

// this guard — database-level immutability does not exist today. What
// IS true: this is currently the ONLY `EvidenceReference` mutation call
// site in the codebase (confirmed via `grep -rn
// "evidenceReference.update"` src/`), so routing every mutation through
// it (as `anchorEvidence()` already does) closes the gap for as long as
// that remains true. A PostgreSQL trigger/constraint was deliberately

  // manual action tied to one specific human role. No real Policy Engine
  // gate exists in this codebase today (searched — there is no "trusted
  // system caller" identity concept modeled anywhere for this), so that
  // intended automation path cannot be enforced here without inventing
  // one, which this mission does not do. The fail-closed default applied
  // instead is the SAME economic-scope boundary as every other action in
  // this evidence chain — a trade participant or current arbiter (or a
  // non-trade Claim's creator) may anchor evidence that is already part
  // of their own Claim's Proof, since anchoring only strengthens
  // integrity assurance for evidence they already have legitimate access
  // to; an unrelated caller may not trigger the real external cost.

  // should exist for this action is a real, open Architecture Decision,
