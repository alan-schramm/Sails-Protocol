 * Issue #254 - immutable, generation-correct provenance for "was this settlement.escrow.released/refunded

 * APPEALED, clearing ruling) at any time, including while THIS event's own projection is still delayed
 * (crash/PASS-3 redelivery, or simply a slower handler) - a query against the row's CURRENT state would
 * then silently misclassify a real disputed release/refund as an ordinary cooperative one (or vice versa),
 * producing an exactly-once but WRONG reputation outcome. Three layered, priority-ordered immutable
 * sources, checked in order of how strong the guarantee is:
 *
 *   1. eventDisputeId - the settlement event's OWN payload.disputeId (escrow.service.ts's
 *      releaseFunds()/refundFunds(), MOCK/WDK_USDT_EVM only). Set by dispute.service.ts's applyRuling() at
 *      the exact moment fund movement is triggered - event-carried and race-free by construction, since it
 *      travels with the durable event itself rather than being looked up later.
 *   2. semantic_transition_records (MULTISIG's existing Core-authoritative provenance,
 *      dispute-outcome.ts/M8-R) - committed BEFORE the settlement action is ever dispatched (that file's
 *      own "STRICTLY PRECEDES... calling any settlement action" ordering) and append-only/immutable from
 *      that point on (a reverted ruling deletes its own row via revertDisputeRulingRecord(), never mutates
 *      it) - reused as-is, no schema change.
 *   3. Legacy/defense-in-depth fallback: the SAME mutable-Dispute query this codebase used before Issue
 *      #254. **Corrected/Implemented (Issue #254B, 2026-09-22):** this section previously disclosed
 *      LIGHTNING_HODL/SAFE_GUARD_EVM as an unfixed BLOCKER, reasoning that closing them would require a
 *      new EscrowPendingTransaction.disputeId schema column. Discovery proved that column (and
 *      rulingAppealRound/rulingArbiterId/rulingOutcome/rulingAuthoritySignature/rulingAuthorityIssuedAt)
 *      already existed - ADR-005/#218's own write-time provenance for the Economic Disposition Commit
 *      Gate, captured by initiateSignatureCollectionCore() the moment a disputed pending operation is
 *      created, immutable thereafter. escrow-pending-tx.ts's submitTransactionSignature() now threads
 *      pending.disputeId onto the settlement event exactly like source #1 above - MULTISIG/LIGHTNING_HODL/
 *      SAFE_GUARD_EVM (every rail that finalizes through that function) all reach source #1 now; only a
