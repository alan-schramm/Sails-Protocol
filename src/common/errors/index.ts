// CROSS-LAYER-SEMANTIC-CORRECTIVE-1 (item 39, 2026-09-13) — closes
// `docs/BACKLOG.md` item 39, registered by
// `docs/CROSS_LAYER_SEMANTIC_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md`'s CSC-G01: six
// structurally different underlying reasons an operation can be
// unavailable (a real rail limitation, an unconfigured deployment, a
// missing permission, a maturity/eligibility gate, a config toggle, an
// unimplemented stub) all used to surface as similarly-worded plain
// `EscrowError`/`Error` text with no way for a caller to mechanically
// tell them apart short of parsing the message string. This is a
// classificatory field added to the EXISTING error envelope — not a
// second error framework, not a new error class per reason. A caller
// (or the Reference UI) that doesn't recognize a `reason` value must
// still work correctly: `reason` is always additive, `code`/`message`
// remain exactly what they always were.
//
// Deliberately named after this mission's own required vocabulary, not
// invented independently — reuse this exact set, never add a 7th
// without updating this comment and every consuming layer:
// - UNSUPPORTED    — a real, structural rail/technical limitation (this
//                    will never work on this rail, not a config issue).
// - UNAVAILABLE    — this deployment hasn't wired a provider/rail that
//                    could exist (a structural absence, not a policy).
// - FORBIDDEN      — a permission/`CapabilityGrant`/policy denial (the
//                    actor lacks authorization, the operation itself is
//                    real and configured). Distinct from the existing
//                    `ForbiddenError` class (401/403 AUTHENTICATION
//                    boundary) — this reason classifies a CAPABILITY
//                    denial specifically, which may or may not also be
//                    surfaced via `ForbiddenError`.
// - INELIGIBLE     — a maturity/capability-profile/eligibility mismatch
//                    (the actor or object doesn't yet qualify).
// - DISABLED       — a deployment config toggle is off (would work if
//                    enabled; this deployment chose not to).
// - NOT_IMPLEMENTED — a genuine SDK/server stub with no real backing
//                    implementation yet.
