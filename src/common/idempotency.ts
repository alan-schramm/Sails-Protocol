/**
 * CROSS-LAYER-SEMANTIC-CORRECTIVE-1 (item 37, 2026-09-13) — closes
 * `docs/BACKLOG.md` item 37 ("Trade/Offer/Evidence Creation
 * Idempotency"), registered by `docs/CROSS_LAYER_SEMANTIC_CONTRACT_AUDIT.md`'s
 * CSC-B01/CSC-B02: `createTrade()`, `createOffer()`, and
 * `submitEvidence()` had no idempotency mechanism at all — a network
 * retry of the identical logical request could create a second `Trade`/
 * `Offer` row or double-append dispute evidence.
 *
 * Deliberately a client-supplied idempotency key, not an accidental
 * DB-uniqueness constraint on business fields (e.g. `(offerId,
 * counterpartyId)` for trade creation) — the audit's own investigation
 * found that composite-business-key uniqueness would incorrectly reject
 * a genuinely new, separate trade the same buyer legitimately intends
 * against the same still-`ACTIVE` offer later (`Offer.status` never
 * transitions away from `ACTIVE` just because one trade was created
 * against it). Only a caller-supplied key can express "this specific
 * attempt," independent of what the request happens to contain.
 *
 * Deliberately opt-in (a caller who never supplies a key gets today's
 * exact, unchanged behavior) — this preserves full backward
 * compatibility for existing callers. **Honestly bounded, not
 * universal**: the idempotency guarantee below applies ONLY when a
 * caller actually supplies a key — a caller that omits one gets no
 * protection at all, same as before this mission ever existed. See
 * `withIdempotency()`'s own doc comment for the recommended strategy
 * question this raises, explicitly left as a registered, undecided
 * Product question, not resolved here.
 *
 * CROSS-LAYER-SEMANTIC-CORRECTIVE-1-R1 (2026-09-13) — closes two real
 * correctness defects a CTO review found in the original version:
 *
 * **Defect A — a successful `create()` could be relabeled FAILED.** The
 * original `runAndSettle()` ran `create()` and `store.markCompleted()`
 * inside the SAME try block, so a `create()` success followed by a
 * `markCompleted()` failure (a real, plausible transient DB error) hit
 * the SAME catch clause as a genuine `create()` failure — marking the
 * claim `FAILED` even though a durable side effect already existed, and
 * letting a future retry call `create()` again. This violated this
 * codebase's own governing principle (`docs/ENGINEERING_GOVERNANCE.md`
 * §16.17): **a failed call is not proof of no side effect.** Fixed by
 * splitting `create()`'s own failure domain from the bookkeeping
 * write's — see `runAndSettle()` and the new `UNKNOWN` status below.
 *
 * **Defect B — `FAILED → retry` was a plain read-then-write, not an
 * atomic claim.** The original code let ANY caller who observed
 * `status === 'FAILED'` proceed straight to `runAndSettle()` with no
 * compare-and-swap — two concurrent retries could both observe `FAILED`
 * and both execute `create()`. Fixed with `reclaimFailed()`, a real,
 * conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'FAILED'` (the exact same
 * "conditional `updateMany` + row-count check" idiom
 * `escrow-lifecycle.ts`'s `claimEscrowTransition()` already uses for
 * `Escrow.status`) — correct across concurrent requests on the SAME
 * application instance and across multiple application instances alike,
 * since the atomicity is Postgres's own, not an in-process lock.
 *
 * The store interface below is injected specifically so the real
 * concurrency-arbitration LOGIC (races, replays, reused keys, the two
 * defects above) can be proven directly, against a real, behaviorally-
 * faithful in-memory implementation that genuinely enforces the same
 * atomicity Postgres provides, without needing a live Postgres
 * connection in this environment (`tests/idempotency.test.ts`) — per
 * this mission's own "do not mock the property being proved" rule. The
 * production store (`PrismaIdempotencyKeyStore` below) is a thin,
 * directly-inspectable wrapper over real, atomic Prisma operations —
 * not a second, competing idempotency mechanism.
 *
 * CROSS-LAYER-SEMANTIC-CORRECTIVE-1-R2 (2026-09-13) — closes a third
 * real defect R1 did not: R1 correctly separated "create() itself
 * failed" from "create() succeeded but bookkeeping failed," but still
 * assumed **create() throwing at all** meant no durable object exists.
 * That assumption was false for every one of the three protected
 * operations — `createTradeUncached()` persists the `Trade` row, then
 * STILL performs `eventBus.emit()`, up to 3 `intentEngine.transition()`
 * calls, and `negotiationService.open()`, any of which can throw AFTER
 * the Trade already exists; `createOfferUncached()` persists the
 * `Intent` and `Offer` rows before its own `eventBus.emit()`;
 * `submitEvidenceUncached()` durably appends evidence via
 * `prisma.dispute.update()` before its own `eventBus.emit()`. A failure
 * in any of those later steps used to hit `runAndSettle()`'s single
 * `create()` catch block and mark the claim `FAILED` — even though a
 * durable business object already existed — letting a retry create a
 * SECOND `Trade`/`Offer` or double-append evidence. Violated the same
 * governing principle Defect A violated, one level deeper: **a failed
 * call is not proof of no side effect**, and retryability must be
 * derived from durable truth, not from whether the outer function
 * threw.
 *
 * **Fix:** `withIdempotency()` now takes two callbacks instead of one —
 * `persist()` (the ONLY code allowed to perform the durable business
 * write; its own failure is the ONLY legitimate `FAILED`, since nothing
 * durable exists yet) and `postPersist()` (everything that must happen
 * AFTER the durable write — events, intent transitions, negotiation
 * setup — whose failures are real and still propagate to the ORIGINAL
 * caller, but can never regress the idempotency record). `runAndSettle()`
 * now settles the record to `COMPLETED`/`UNKNOWN` (Defect A's own
 * machinery, unchanged) IMMEDIATELY after `persist()` succeeds — BEFORE
 * `postPersist()` ever runs — so the record reflects durable truth no
 * matter what `postPersist()` does next. A retry with the same key,
 * once `persist()` has ever succeeded, always recovers the real object
 * via `recover()`; it never re-runs `persist()` again. This deliberately
 * does NOT retry `postPersist()` on a recovered replay — resuming a
 * partially-failed orchestration (a stuck negotiation channel, an
 * unfired event) is a real, separate, larger question this bounded
 * correction does not solve; see each call site's own comment for the
 * disclosed residual this leaves.
 *
 * CROSS-LAYER-SEMANTIC-CORRECTIVE-1-R3 (2026-09-13) — closes a fourth
 * real defect: R2 treated `persist()` as a single, indivisible unit —
 * correct for `createTrade()`/`submitEvidence()` (each has exactly ONE
 * durable write in `persist()`), but NOT for `createOffer()`, whose
 * `persistOffer()` performs TWO independently-durable writes:
 * `intentEngine.create()` (an Intent, durable as soon as it returns),
 * then `prisma.offer.create()` (the Offer). If the SECOND write fails,
 * `persist()` as a whole throws, and `runAndSettle()` marks the claim
 * `FAILED` — even though the FIRST write already durably succeeded. A
 * retry then reclaims `FAILED` and calls `persist()` again, which
 * unconditionally re-runs `intentEngine.create()`, producing a SECOND
 * Intent for the same logical `createOffer` attempt. Same governing
 * principle, one level deeper still: **a failed `persist()` call is not
 * proof that NONE of persist()'s own internal writes durably happened.**
 *
 * **R3's original fix attempt (superseded by R4 below, kept here as
 * history):** introduced a `PersistCheckpoint` argument to `persist()` —
 * `checkpoint.set(ref)` recorded an intermediate result on a new
 * `checkpointRef` column, read back as `checkpoint.ref` on a later
 * retry. **This mechanism has been REMOVED** — see R4.
 *
 * CROSS-LAYER-SEMANTIC-CORRECTIVE-1-R4 (2026-09-13) — a CTO review found
 * R3's own fix was itself unsafe: `checkpoint.set()` was a SEPARATE
 * write from the durable object it was meant to checkpoint, and that
 * separate write could itself fail — either definitely (nothing
 * committed) or ambiguously (the `UPDATE` may have committed but the
 * acknowledgement was lost) — reintroducing the exact same defect one
 * level deeper: **a failed checkpoint write is not proof the checkpoint
 * wasn't recorded, and is not proof the object it describes wasn't
 * created either.** Naively retrying `intentEngine.create()` whenever
 * `checkpoint.set()` failed would have reproduced R3's own original bug.
 *
 * **Fix — no separate checkpoint write at all.** The durable object a
 * multi-write `persist()` creates FIRST (an Intent, for `createOffer()`)
 * now carries its own idempotency-claim marker as a column on ITSELF
 * (`Intent.idempotencyClaimId`, `prisma/schema.prisma`), written
 * atomically as part of the SAME `INSERT` that creates the row — not a
 * second statement, so there is no window at all between "the object
 * exists" and "its marker is durable" for `checkpoint.set()` to fail
 * inside. The marker's value is the ORIGINATING `IdempotencyKey` row's
 * own `id` — already durable and already known in memory (`runAndSettle()`
 * receives it as `claimId`) the instant `persist()` is invoked, requiring
 * no extra read or write to obtain. `persist()`'s signature is therefore
 * simply `(claimId: string | null) => Promise<T>` — `null` when no
 * idempotency key was supplied. A retry looks the marker up directly via
 * `IntentRepository.findByIdempotencyClaimId()` BEFORE attempting to
 * create anything — durable truth read from a single already-committed
 * row, with no dependency on any OTHER table's bookkeeping. A genuine
 * concurrent double-attempt (two application instances racing the same
 * reclaimed claim) is still resolved correctly: `Intent.idempotencyClaimId`
 * carries a real `@unique` constraint, so at most one `prisma.intent.create()`
 * with a given marker can ever land — the loser sees Postgres's own
 * P2002 and reconciles via the identical "insert-as-lock, catch P2002,
 * look up the winner" idiom `IdempotencyKey.claim()` itself already
 * uses (see the newly-exported `isUniqueConstraintError()` below).
 *
 * This does NOT make `intentEngine.create()` itself transactional or
 * resumable internally (its own multi-step CREATED→VALIDATED→COORDINATED
 * pipeline can itself partially fail after its first durable write —
 * a real, narrower, pre-existing gap, unchanged and out of this
 * mission's scope, same as R2/R3 already disclosed: a retry that
 * reconciles via `idempotencyClaimId` may reuse an Intent that never
 * finished that pipeline). It only guarantees that `persistOffer()`'s
 * OWN Intent-creation step cannot run more than once for the same
 * idempotency key, and needs no separate bookkeeping write to prove it.

 *
 * CROSS-LAYER-SEMANTIC-CORRECTIVE-1-R2 — `persist()` and `postPersist()`
 * are deliberately two separate callbacks, not one. `persist()` must
 * contain ONLY the durable business write (and nothing that can be
 * skipped without leaving a half-created object); its own thrown error
 * is the ONLY thing that marks the claim `FAILED` (see `runAndSettle()`).
 * `postPersist(result)` runs AFTER the claim has already been settled to

 * ORIGINAL caller of `withIdempotency()` (a real error, not swallowed),
 * but can never regress the idempotency record, and are never re-run on
 * a later replay with the same key (that replay goes straight to
 * `recover()`). Getting this boundary right per call site is the
 * caller's responsibility — see `trade.service.ts`, `liquidity.service.ts`,
 * and `dispute.service.ts` for the three audited boundaries this
 * mission established.
 *
 * CROSS-LAYER-SEMANTIC-CORRECTIVE-1-R4 — `persist()` also receives the
 * ORIGINATING `IdempotencyKey` row's own `id` (`null` when no idempotency
 * key was supplied). This is a plain, already-durable value — no new
 * write is needed to obtain it — for a `persist()` with more than one
 * independently-durable internal write to stamp onto whichever object it
 * creates FIRST, so a later retry can deterministically re-discover that
 * object (see `liquidity.service.ts`'s `persistOffer()` and
 * `Intent.idempotencyClaimId`) instead of depending on a separate,
 * independently-failure-prone checkpoint write (R3's original approach,
 * removed — see this file's own header).
 *
 * **Opt-in boundary, stated plainly for whoever next has to decide this
 * Product question (not decided here):** today, an idempotency key is
 * optional at every layer (route schema, SDK method, UI call site).
 * This keeps the change fully backward-compatible, but means a caller
 * who doesn't know to pass one — a raw API integrator who never reads
 * this file, or a future SDK version that forgets to — gets no
 * protection at all, silently. Candidate bounded strategies, in
 * increasing order of how much they change today's contract: (1) keep
 * opt-in for compatibility, document the boundary loudly (this comment,
 * `docs/API_STABLE.md`, `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`) — the status quo as of
 * this correction; (2) have the SDK generate a key by default when the
 * caller doesn't supply one (protects every SDK-mediated caller
 * automatically, still leaves raw API integrators unprotected unless
 * they opt in themselves); (3) make the key mandatory in a future,
 * explicitly-versioned breaking contract once real usage data justifies
 * it. This function does not choose between them — that is a Product/
 * API-contract decision, not an implementation detail to decide
 * silently inside a bounded corrective mission.
