/**
 * Capability Registry — Sails Protocol Core Component
 * PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md section 1.10, rfcs/RFC-005-capability-model.md
 * (the `Capability`/`CapabilityGrant` shapes), rfcs/RFC-013-capability-registry-and-wallet-adapter.md
 * (this file's first real implementation — stub since Architecture Freeze).
 *
 * Real, not a stub. Only `CapabilityGrant` (the permission side) is
 * persisted — `Capability`/`CapabilityImplementation` (the static
 * moduleId <-> capabilityName mapping RFC-005's own table lists as
 * "illustrative... a Reference Implementation detail") stays an
 * in-code map below, since it has no real write path in this pass
 * (RFC-013's Alternatives Considered).
 *
 * Corrects a signature drift found while implementing: the pre-RFC-013
 * stub's `grant(capability: Capability): Promise<void>` predates RFC-005
 * disambiguating `Capability` from `CapabilityGrant` and was never
 * updated — it took the wrong shape (the abstract category, not the
 * permission grant) and returned nothing a caller could reference later.
 * Fixed here as part of making this real, not a silent behavior change
 * to code that never actually ran (the stub only ever threw).
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT_REPORT.md recommendation #3, step 1, closed
 * 2026-08-08 — all `prisma.capabilityGrant.*` access moved to
 * `capability-grant-repository.ts`; this file no longer imports `prisma`
 * or knows the raw persisted row shape at all. `createCapabilityRegistry()`
 * is a factory function, not a class — `capabilityRegistry` itself was
 * always a plain object literal implementing the `CapabilityRegistry`
 * interface, so there's no class to add a constructor to; the factory
 * takes the repository as an optional parameter (defaulting to the real
 * singleton) instead, giving tests the same seam a constructor would
 * (`createCapabilityRegistry(fakeRepo)` instead of
 * `jest.mock('../common/database', ...)`), with the real, always-used
 * `capabilityRegistry` export's own call sites completely unchanged.
