/**
 * WebSocketRelayTransportProvider — secondary TransportProvider
 * 03-implementation_plan.md section 3; CISO Privacy Rule ("Blind Relay").
 *
 * Activates only when PearsTransportProvider doesn't connect within the
 * fallback timeout (see FallbackTransportProvider, transport-provider.ts).
 * This class never inspects, decrypts, or logs payload contents — it
 * forwards whatever bytes it's given, verbatim, to the target
 * participant's registered socket (PRINCIPLES.md principle 8, Privacy
 * Preserving; SECURITY_MODEL.md "Privacy by Design"). If a future caller
 * needs to *read* a payload here to make a routing decision, that is
 * exactly the violation this rule exists to prevent.
 *
 * Accuracy note (found while wiring `PearsTransportProvider.sendIntentToPeer`,
 * transport-provider.ts): this class previously claimed app-layer
 * "Secretstream/E2E encryption already happens above this layer" as a
 * blanket statement. That's now true specifically for Intent payloads sent
 * via `sendIntentToPeer` (real libsodium sealed-box encryption,
 * `payload-crypto.ts`) — it was never true for chat/negotiation messages
 * (`chat.routes.ts`, `negotiation.service.ts`'s `HumanChatChannel`), which
 * still send plain JSON. Both cases DO get Hyperswarm's own Noise-handshake
 * transport encryption when routed via Pears (real, inherent to
 * `hyperswarm`/`hyperdht`, not this class's concern) — but this relay has
 * no such transport-level encryption of its own, so an unencrypted
 * chat/negotiation payload really is only as private as this WebSocket
 * connection (TLS in front of it, in a real deployment). Not fixed here —
 * flagged, same as every other gap found this way in this codebase.
 *
 * Connection registration is asymmetric from PearsTransportProvider by
 * necessity: HyperDHT connections are peer-initiated (PearNode.start()
 * actively bootstraps a DHT node); WebSocket connections are
 * client-initiated (a participant's client connects to this server's `/ws`
 * upgrade endpoint). `start()` below registers readiness; `registerSocket()`
 * is what a Fastify WS route handler calls once the actual connection
 * lands — see app.ts's `/ws/relay` route.
