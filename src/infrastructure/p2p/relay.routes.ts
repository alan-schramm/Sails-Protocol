/**
 * WebSocket relay route — `/ws/relay`. Gives `WebSocketRelayTransportProvider`
 * (websocket-relay.service.ts) a real socket to register against.
 *
 * Until this file existed, `WebSocketRelayTransportProvider` and
 * `FallbackTransportProvider` (transport-provider.ts) were real and
 * unit-tested in isolation (transportFallback.test.ts, with fake
 * TransportProvider/socket doubles) but had no live wiring — a class
 * comment in websocket-relay.service.ts referenced "app.ts's `/ws/relay`
 * route" that did not exist anywhere in this codebase. A fallback to a
 * relay that no client can ever reach is not a fallback; this is the
 * missing piece that makes it real.
 *
 * Auth follows chat.routes.ts's exact pattern (`?ticket=` query param, a
 * short-lived single-use value minted by POST /v1/identity/ws-ticket and
 * burned on first resolution — not `requireAuth`'s Authorization-header
 * check, because a WebSocket upgrade request from a browser client can't
 * set arbitrary headers, the same constraint that route already
 * documents). Migrated off a raw `?token=` session token, 2026-08-15
 * security review P1 — see ws-auth.ts's resolveParticipantFromTicket()
 * for the full rationale. Note this route currently has no in-repo SDK
 * client (grep confirms `packages/sails-sdk` never constructs a
 * `/ws/relay` URL) — any external client connecting here needs the same
 * paired update: fetch a ticket via the authenticated HTTP endpoint
 * first, then open the socket with `?ticket=`, not `?token=`.
 *
 * Scope, stated plainly: this makes `start()`/`sendToPeer()` degrade
 * gracefully when Pears/HyperDHT hole-punching doesn't complete in time
 * (restrictive NAT, corporate firewall — transportFallback.test.ts's
 * timeout/reject cases). It does NOT give the relay a DHT-topic
 * equivalent — `/v1/peers/join-trade` and `/v1/peers/broadcast-offer`
 * still require a real PearNode and will 409 for a participant who fell
 * back to the relay. That is a structural limit of a point-to-point
 * relay, not an oversight (see transport-provider.ts's `FallbackTransportProvider`
 * class comment).
