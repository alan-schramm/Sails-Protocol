# Sails Protocol - production server image (2026-08-02)
#
# Built for AWS App Runner's "source code repository" build path, but
# runs anywhere a plain OCI image does. bookworm-slim (glibc), not
# alpine - this project's real native dependencies (sodium-native,
# tiny-secp256k1) either ship no prebuilt musl binaries or are markedly
# less reliable to compile against musl; glibc is the boring, correct
# choice for this dependency set, not a default left unexamined.
#
# Builds exactly what `npm run build` already builds locally (verified
# throughout this repo's own history) - no separate build logic invented
# for Docker. Does NOT run `prisma migrate`/`db push` here: schema
# changes are applied as their own explicit step against the target
# database (see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md), never implicitly on container start,
# so a bad migration can't silently run every time the service restarts.
#
# Layer-cache optimization (added 2026-08-07, preserves behavior):
#   - package*.json copies happen BEFORE `npm ci`, so a source-only change
#     does not invalidate the dependency install layer.
#   - Multi-stage builder -> pruned -> runtime stays unchanged: production
#     image still gets the slim node_modules tree, devDependencies still
#     pruned.
#   - Non-root user (`node`) added to the runtime stage so a future
#     container-escape doesn't land as root inside the host namespace.

# 2026-08-03) - `redis-memory-server`/`embedded-postgres` (devDependencies
# used only for local test infra, see docs/DEPLOYMENT.md section 3) each
# have a postinstall that tries to compile/download a full server binary
# from source (Redis with RedisBloom/RediSearch/RedisJSON modules, in
# redis-memory-server's case - needs cmake/pkg-config/a Python
# interpreter, none of which this image has or needs). Neither package is
# ever imported by the production server; skipping install scripts
# entirely avoids paying for infrastructure this image will never use.
# The one script that DOES matter - `@prisma/client`'s own `prisma
# generate` - is run explicitly right after, since skipping scripts
# means it no longer fires automatically.

# Now bring in the rest of the source. Anything that changes here
# invalidates the npm-ci cache above, but the `npm run build` step

# enables that transport when NODE_ENV=development, and devDependencies
# have to actually be present for it to load) and the real `prisma` CLI.
# Production, below, prunes them - a separate named stage so "local dev
# wants devDependencies, production must not ship them" doesn't fight
# itself in one stage (found the hard way, 2026-08-03: pointing
# docker-compose at this stage `AS builder` after the prune already ran
# crashed on the exact same missing-pino-pretty error the runtime image
# has, defeating the entire reason to target `builder` in the first

# Only what src/main.js actually needs at runtime: the pruned

# own module resolution wants it present for the "type"/"main" fields).
#
# node_modules/@sails/sdk and @sails/p2p-schemas are npm-workspaces
# SYMLINKS (to ../../packages/<name>), not real copies - Docker COPY
# preserves symlinks as-is, so their *targets* must exist at the same
# relative path in this stage too, or the require() they point at 404s
# at container start. Both dist/ (the built JS) and package.json (whose
# "main"/"exports" field is what actually gets resolved through the
# symlink) are copied for each; src/tsconfig/tests are not needed here.
#
# packages/sails-sdk/node_modules/@noble - found the hard way (first
# real `docker run`, 2026-08-03): npm nests a SEPARATE @noble/curves
# v2.x here because escrow-key.ts/kms-signer.ts need it, while the root
# tree stays on v1.2.0 for everything else (that version split is
# exactly what those two files' own header comments already disclose).
# Without this nested copy, Node's module resolution silently falls
# through to the root's incompatible v1.2.0 and crashes at import time
# with ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED - invisible in `npm test` (Jest's
# own transformIgnorePatterns sidesteps this entirely, see
# jest.config.js's own comment) and invisible in every `tsc --noEmit`/
# `npm run build` check this repo has ever run, since none of those
# actually execute the compiled output the way `node dist/src/main.js`
# does. Only a real run of the built artifact surfaces it.
