## 1. Layered Architecture — Protocol / Application / Infrastructure / Domain

This is the mandatory separation across the entire codebase. Every file you
write must belong to exactly one of these four layers, and must not reach
into another layer's responsibilities directly — only through events or
well-defined interfaces.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PROTOCOL LAYER                                                   │
│ Interfaces, event contracts, type definitions. Technology-        │
│ agnostic. Lives conceptually in packages/protocol-spec.           │
│ Examples: SettlementProvider interface, IntentPrimitive type,     │
│ EventContract type map.                                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ APPLICATION LAYER                                                 │

│ Sails OpenP2P's trade lifecycle logic lives — it calls into        │
│ cross-module services but owns none of their internals.           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ DOMAIN LAYER                                                      │
│ The actual business entities and their rules: Trade, Escrow,      │
│ Offer, User/Participant, ReputationEvent. Each entity belongs to   │
│ exactly one module (see moduleId in DATABASE.md).                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER                                              │
│ How bytes actually move: HyperDHT/Hyperswarm P2P transport,       │
│ PostgreSQL connection, Redis connection, HTTP server (Fastify).   │
│ Infrastructure code must never know what a "Trade" or an "Offer"  │
│ is — it moves opaque payloads.                                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### A real example of a layer violation that was found and fixed

During the last code review pass, `escrow.service.ts` (Domain/Application,
belongs to OpenSettlement) was calling `prisma.trade.update(...)` and
`prisma.user.update(...)` directly — reaching into Trade (owned by OpenP2P)
and User/reputation stats (owned by OpenReputation). This is exactly the
kind of violation this separation exists to prevent.

**Fix applied:** `escrow.service.ts` now only emits
`settlement.escrow.*` events. A new file, `common/events/handlers.ts`,
listens for those events and performs the Trade and User updates — keeping
each write inside the module that owns that data.

Another real example: `pear.service.ts` (HyperDHT/Hyperswarm transport —
pure Infrastructure) used to live inside `modules/identity/` (Domain). It
was moved to `infrastructure/p2p/pear.service.ts`. It was also found to
accept an `Offer`-shaped object in its `broadcastOffer()` method signature —
a Domain concept leaking into Infrastructure. Fixed by making the broadcast
method accept a generic `Record<string, unknown>` payload instead.

**The rule going forward:** if you're writing Infrastructure code and you
find yourself importing a type from a Domain module (`Offer`, `Trade`,
`User`), stop — that's a violation. Either the Infrastructure code should
accept an opaque payload, or the logic belongs in the Domain/Application
layer instead.

## 1B. The Core — 6 Formal Components (v7.1 — Principal Engineer decision)

Following the CTO architectural review and a formal test applied to every
proposed addition (see `PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` sections 1.10-1.11), the
Core is now six named components — not an implicit grab-bag of logic
scattered across `common/`:

```
Intent Engine        → routes Intents by type, never knows about modules
                        (PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md section 2)
Coordination Engine   → receives Intent + Policy + Capability + Events,
                        decides, then activates modules. No module ever
                        calls another module directly — only the Core.
Event Bus             → namespaced {module}.{entity}.{action} events.
                        Exposes a per-correlationId Timeline read
                        projection (RFC-007, rfcs/RFC-007-real-world-p2p-
                        requirements.md, decision D5) — ordered events for
                        one correlationId. Corrected 2026-07-19: this used
                        to say "one intentId," matching RFC-007 D5's first
                        draft — RFC-017 corrected the key to correlationId
                        (real events carry tradeId today, no Intent-to-
                        Trade link existing yet to key by intentId), and
                        the two lines directly below already said
                        correlationId — this line just hadn't caught up.
                        Considered and rejected as a 10th primitive in
                        that RFC; it lives here instead, consistent with
                        Event itself never being a primitive
                        (PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md section 1.11).
                        RFC-008 (rfcs/RFC-008-verifiable-timestamps-and-
                        chained-timeline.md) hash-chains each
                        TimelineEntry (entryHash/prevHash, persisted on
                        EscrowEvent/ReputationEvent) so tampering is
                        detectable — this is the one place D5's original
                        "no new write path" claim was later corrected.
                        RFC-010 (rfcs/RFC-010-durable-event-store.md)
                        makes durability pluggable via a new EventStore
                        Adapter (protocol says "must be durable and
                        correlated," never names a backend — Redis
                        Streams/BullMQ stays a Reference Implementation
                        choice) and requires every event to carry a
                        correlationId (tradeId today, intentId once
                        Intent persistence exists; userId for
                        peer/transport events with no trade to correlate
                        to).
State Machine          → the canonical Intent lifecycle (11 states as of
                        RFC-012, rfcs/RFC-012-intent-validation-and-
                        coordination.md, which added VALIDATED/COORDINATED)
Capability Registry    → tracks which Capability (functional category,
                        e.g. trade-coordination) each moduleId implements,
                        and issues/checks CapabilityGrants (permissions) —
                        two related interfaces per RFC-005
                        (rfcs/RFC-005-capability-model.md), not one.
                        CapabilityGrant issuance/checking is real as of
                        RFC-013 (rfcs/RFC-013-capability-registry-and-
                        wallet-adapter.md, `core/capability-registry.ts`);
                        the module<->Capability mapping stays a static
                        in-code table (RFC-005's own table, verbatim),
                        not a second persisted store
Policy / Rules Engine  → FeePolicy, TrustPolicy, RoutingPolicy — consulted
                        by the Coordination Engine, never read directly
                        by a module. This is what turns PROTOCOL_ECONOMY.md's
                        prose-only fee model into an actual architectural
                        concept.
```

**Why Coordination Engine matters specifically:** today, cross-module
reactions live in `common/events/handlers.ts` (see section 5 below) — a
flat, reactive event listener. The Coordination Engine is the same idea
formalized and given real decision-making inputs (Policy + Capability, not
just the event payload) — the actual "brain" that decides what happens
next, rather than a bag of independent `eventBus.on(...)` handlers. This is
a Months 1-3 roadmap item, not something the current code fragment already
implements — see `TODO.md`.

## 1C. Four Layers (v7.1 — replaces an earlier 7-layer proposal)

```
Tether Ecosystem
    │
    ▼
Open Infrastructure Stack (WDK + Pears + QVAC)
    │
    ▼
Sails Protocol — Core Coordination Tier
    │   (Intent Engine · Coordination Engine · Event Bus ·
    │    State Machine · Capability Registry · Policy/Rules Engine)
    ▼
Capabilities (the 8 modules: OpenP2P · OpenSettlement · OpenLiquidity ·
              OpenIdentity · OpenReputation · OpenAgents · OpenFinance ·
              OpenProof — added RFC-006)
    │
    ▼
Applications (Reference Implementations + third-party integrations)
```

An earlier draft proposed seven numbered layers (Transport, Identity,
Coordination, Capabilities, Modules, SDK, Applications). This four-layer
version replaces it — simpler, and it was the CTO's own final synthesis
after reviewing the more granular version. Use this one.

## 2. The Economic Sub-Capabilities Grouping (conceptual middle layer)

Between the Protocol Layer's abstract interfaces and the concrete modules
sits a conceptual grouping of 7 sub-capabilities that any application
module draws on. **Naming note (v7.3):** this grouping was previously
called "Economic Coordination Layer" — renamed here to avoid colliding
with section 1C's "Sails Protocol — Core Coordination Tier," which is a
different thing (the whole protocol's position in the 4-tier ecosystem
view, not this 7-item internal grouping).

```
Participant Layer   — identity, trust, reputation
Discovery Layer      — find counterparties, liquidity, opportunities
Negotiation Sub-Layer — negotiate, agree, commit (chat + state machine)
Escrow Layer         — lock, protect, release funds
Settlement Layer     — on-chain execution (via WDK)
Communication Layer  — E2E channels (via Secretstream/Pears)
Intelligence Layer   — QVAC local AI (cross-cutting, not an isolated layer)
```

Note: "Intelligence Layer" (QVAC) is listed here for completeness, but it is
explicitly **not** a layer that other layers depend on. It is a
cross-cutting accelerator — any layer above can optionally call into it, but
none require it to function. This is intentional: the protocol must work
completely with human participants alone; QVAC is the natural evolution, not
the foundation. See `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` section on the causal adoption
argument for why this distinction matters strategically as well as
technically.

**Crypto-Native Agent boundary (RFC-016):** every action QVAC/OpenAgents
takes inside this layer is on digital assets already in the user's
wallet, via WDK — never on fiat. QVAC is a **Crypto-Native Agent**, not
a "PIX Agent" or "Banking Agent"; fiat-to-crypto conversion happens
earlier, through a regulated on/off-ramp provider, outside this layer
and outside Sails Protocol's scope entirely. See
`docs/rfcs/RFC-016-qvac-crypto-native-agent-boundary.md`.

## 3. The 8 Official Modules

Full detail (responsibilities, interfaces, event namespaces) is in
`PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md`. Summary here. The **Marketplace role** column
is the v1 Positioning Freeze framing — the one-line answer to "what does
this module do for a P2P Financial Marketplace," fixed wording, use as-is
in pitch/onboarding material. The **Responsibility** column is the
full technical detail and is unchanged.

### Cross-module services (used by any application module)

| Module | Marketplace role | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Sails OpenIdentity** | Provides portable identity for buyers, sellers, and liquidity providers. | Ed25519 keypair as sovereign identity. Every participant, regardless of which application module they're using, has exactly one OpenIdentity. Growth path: Keys → DID → Credentials → Trust Graph, plus Operational Profiles (RFC-007) — a module-level, Policy-Engine-facing role attribute (`regular_trader`, `liquidity_provider`, `merchant`, `arbitrator`, `agent`), not KYC and not part of the `Identity` primitive's core contract. |
| **Sails OpenReputation** | Manages accumulated reputation. | Portable score tied to the keypair, not to any platform. Any module can read or write reputation. Outcome-based (RFC-007): `recordOutcome()` is the sole `ReputationScore` input via an internal Outcome Engine; star ratings (`rate()`) are informational feedback only and never move the score. A cancelled-by-agreement trade always classifies Neutral, never Negative. |
| **Sails OpenSettlement** | Coordinates settlement and escrow release. | Abstract escrow via the `SettlementProvider` interface. Pluggable: Mock → Multisig 2-of-3 → Lightning HODL → Liquid Covenant. Settlement status gains `PendingBankSettlement` (RFC-007) for payment held/processing at a financial institution before it clears. Also implements Dispute, with an explicit escalation order — Policy Engine → OpenAgents → Trusted Arbitrator (via the new `ArbitrationProvider` interface) → Settlement — before falling back to human arbitration (RFC-007). |
| **Sails OpenLiquidity** | Organizes liquidity providers. | Discovery and routing of liquidity. The order book (the `Offer` entity) belongs here, not to OpenP2P — this is what lets OpenFinance reuse the same discovery mechanism in the future without duplicating it. |
| **Sails OpenProof** | Records cryptographically verifiable evidence. | Standardizes `Claim` → `Proof` → `Verification` (RFC-003) for every other module — Dispute evidence, Negotiation payment proof, future OpenFinance underwriting all consume this instead of each building their own evidence format. Added as the 8th module by RFC-006. RFC-007 adds a Proof Registry (fingerprints evidence, flags reuse across Intents), an `EvidenceProvider` adapter interface (Nostr.build/S3/R2/IPFS/Arweave — the protocol never hosts media itself), and `getEvidenceBundle(intentId)`, a read aggregate over Claims/Proofs/Verifications/Timeline/external references for one Intent. RFC-008 adds an optional `TimestampAnchor` adapter (OpenTimestamps/RFC 3161) so evidence timestamps can be proven, not just self-declared — policy-gated, not mandatory. |

### Application modules (build on the above)

| Module | Marketplace role | Responsibility | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sails OpenP2P** | Coordinates negotiation between participants. | Orchestrates the Trade Lifecycle (9 states, see `PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md`) using the five cross-module services above. Owns the Secretstream chat / negotiation channel. Reconciles against Postgres on peer reconnect (RFC-011) — a dropped HyperDHT/Pears message never actually lost data (every send already persists to `Message` first), it only lost real-time notification, which `ReconciliationService` catches back up on `peer.connected`. | ✅ Proven |
| **Sails OpenAgents** | Runs automation, fraud prevention, risk analysis, and mediation assistance. | QVAC integration as a cross-cutting SDK — a **Crypto-Native Agent** (RFC-016): only ever acts on digital assets via WDK (negotiate, create/accept offers, lock/release escrow), never on fiat or banking rails. Any module can request matching, fraud detection, or risk analysis locally, without cloud dependency. **Social Engineering Agent real as of RFC-017** (`social-engineering-agent.ts`) — watches real chat messages (via the real `Timeline` read-model, RFC-007 D5/RFC-017) for two of RFC-007 D7's three named fraud-precursor patterns (off-channel migration, payment-instruction changes) using QVAC, and raises a real `RISK_WARNING` in the trade's chat — detection only, never unilateral action; the third pattern (unexpected flow deviation) and full Policy Engine integration remain future work (RFC-017's own scope note). Off by default (`config.features.socialEngineeringDetection`). | 🟡 First real capabilities |
| **Sails OpenFinance** | Stays ready for future expansion, out of scope for the MVP. | Future financial modules: `LoanIntent`, `SwapIntent`, `EarnIntent`. Reuses OpenSettlement, OpenLiquidity, OpenReputation without duplicating logic. | 📋 Aspirational |
| **Sails SDK** (MVP release: **Sails P2P Trading SDK**) | The single interface a wallet integrates to get the whole Marketplace. | `@sails/sdk` — a TypeScript wrapper (`SailsClient`) around every module's API, for integrators. Adds no new logic — pure interface encapsulation. | 📋 Aspirational (spec only, see `SDK_GUIDE.md`) |

**Why the OpenP2P/OpenLiquidity split matters:** a common mistake is putting
the `Offer` entity inside the OpenP2P module because "that's where trading
happens." This was corrected — `Offer` belongs to OpenLiquidity
(`moduleId: "openliquidity"`) precisely because OpenFinance will need offers
and liquidity discovery too, someday, without rebuilding it from scratch.

## 4. Actual Code Inventory (verified against the filesystem — do not assume more exists)

**Known stale below 2026-07-17 (QVAC/WDK MVP pass) — not a full rewrite in
this pass, flagged rather than silently left wrong:** the tree and the
"Still missing" note at the end of this section predate the
route-restoration, open-reputation, and chat-unification work done
earlier the same day — `modules/open-identity/`, the `open-p2p` trade/chat
routes, and `modules/open-reputation/` all exist and are real now (see
`TODO.md` §1 and `BACKLOG.md`'s P0-P2 tables, both of which were kept
current through that work). Only the additions below are guaranteed
accurate as of this note; treat the rest of the tree as a lower-confidence
snapshot until someone re-audits the whole section against the filesystem.

**Refreshed against the real filesystem (03-implementation_plan.md MVP
pass) — the version of this section before this pass was itself stale,
listing several files (`common/database/index.ts`, `common/errors/index.ts`,
`common/redis/index.ts`, `config/index.ts`) as "missing" that already
existed by the time RFC-007 through RFC-011 were written. This is what's
actually on disk today:**

**Still missing** (referenced by `app.ts`'s own comments but not present):
`modules/open-identity/` (routes + service), `modules/open-p2p/`'s trade
and chat *routes* (the negotiation *service* above is real), 
`modules/open-reputation/` (routes + service), and every other
`*.routes.ts` file besides `intentRoutes.ts`.

If you're rebuilding these, follow the naming and event conventions in this
handoff exactly — do not reintroduce the old unnamespaced patterns (see
`CONTRIBUTING.md` for the specific rules and a worked example).

**On the crypto-related files named above** (`payload-crypto.ts`,
`middleware/auth.ts`, `pear.service.ts`'s keypair handling): what each
one actually guarantees — and doesn't — is consolidated in
`CRYPTOGRAPHIC_MODEL.md`, not repeated here. `TRUST_BOUNDARY.md` maps
which of these sit at a trust-boundary crossing and what crosses it.

## 5. Event-Driven Coordination (the "zero coupling" mechanism)

No module imports another module's service directly. Ever. The only shared
dependency between modules is the typed event bus
(`common/events/event-bus.ts`).

```
EscrowService (OpenSettlement)
   │  emits 'settlement.escrow.released'
   ▼
eventBus  ──────────────────────────────────────►  handlers.ts
                                                    (Coordination Protocol)
                                                       │
                                    reacts by updating Trade (OpenP2P)
                                    and User stats (OpenReputation)
```

This is what makes the "eliminate unnecessary coupling" requirement concrete
and checkable: grep the codebase for any module importing another module's
service class directly. If you find one, it's a bug — replace it with an
event emission + a handler.

Full event catalog with exact names is in `PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` and
mirrored in `API_REFERENCE.md` for the WebSocket-facing subset.

---

## 6. Monorepo Target Structure (where the code is going, not yet where it is)

```
sails-protocol/                    ← monorepo root (does not exist yet)
├── packages/
│   ├── protocol-spec/             ← @sails/protocol-spec (npm, technology-agnostic)
│   │   └── src/
│   │       ├── core/              (IntentPrimitive, ParticipantIdentity, types)
│   │       ├── modules/           (one interfaces.ts per module)
│   │       └── events/            (EventContract, typed per module)
│   └── sdk/                       ← @sails/sdk (npm, consumer-facing)
│       └── src/SailsClient.ts
└── apps/
    └── satsails-reference/        ← THIS is where today's code fragment lives
        └── src/... (see inventory above)
```

The current fragment lives conceptually where `apps/satsails-reference/src/`
would be — there is no monorepo tooling (no `packages/` split, no
`turbo.json`/`nx.json`) set up yet. That's a `Meses 1-3` roadmap item, not
something to invent ad hoc.

## 7. Diagram Reference (canonical, use exactly this shape in any deck or doc)

`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` section 3 has two canonical diagrams, one per audience
— do not redraw either differently between documents; consistency here was
a specific, deliberate fix applied after a strategic review found the
diagram drifting between documents, and the v1 Positioning Freeze re-applied
the same rule to the newer diagram below:

- **Ecosystem diagram** (Tether → WDK+Pears+QVAC → Sails Protocol →
  8 modules → SDK → Applications → Reference Implementations) — for
  strategic, grant, and partnership context, answering "where does Sails
  sit in the Tether ecosystem."
- **Developer diagram** (Wallet → Sails P2P Trading SDK → Sails Protocol →
  8 modules → WDK/Pears/QVAC → Bitcoin·Liquid·Lightning·USDT) — for
  `README.md`, `SDK_GUIDE.md`, and onboarding material, answering "what
  does a developer actually build on." This is also the diagram used in
  `DEVELOPER_JOURNEY.md`. "Sails P2P Trading SDK" is the first named
  release under the Named-SDK Rule (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` section 3) —
  permanent, not an MVP placeholder that reverts to generic "Sails SDK"
  once other modules ship. Developer-facing material uses the concrete
  name; architecture/spec tables below keep the generic "Sails SDK" as
  the underlying package/interface family name only.
