### Sails Protocol — Product / Engineering Roadmap

## Current production-open status

> **Current truth (2026-09-19): Sails is not yet production-open.** The roadmap describes target sequencing and commitments; it is not a production-readiness certificate.
>
> Production-open remains gated by the Day-0 / Partner Beta completion program and unresolved MUST-FIX owners, including current work on evidence durability/authorization, economic-limit enforcement, temporal ordering, authority liveness, accounting crash consistency and durable downstream projection completion.
>
> Canonical operational owners: GitHub Issue #105 (Day-0 completion gate), #220 (Production Surface Audit / remediation program), and their bounded child/related issues. Do not infer Production Eligibility from implementation existence, passing unit tests, provider registration, or roadmap placement.

## Standing Network-Effect Commitment — Wallet Kits + Settlement Rails

The Sails P2P Trading SDK should ship with first-party integration paths for
the major wallet development kits and the major settlement-capable networks
relevant to P2P markets. The objective is not to make every integrator adopt
the Reference Wallet's stack; it is to let existing wallets join the Sails
network with minimal replacement cost.

Initial **planned** first-party adapter targets:

- `@sails/adapter-bdk`
- `@sails/adapter-wdk`
- `@sails/adapter-breez`
- `@sails/adapter-spark`
- `@sails/adapter-ldk`
- `@sails/adapter-ethers` — EVM family, including BNB Smart Chain
- `@sails/adapter-tron`
- `@sails/adapter-solana`
- `@sails/adapter-ton`

These package names are roadmap targets, not published/support claims yet.
Additional adapters are added by ecosystem relevance and integrator demand.
Settlement-network expansion remains property-gated: a network is eligible
because its primitives can satisfy the required Sails settlement semantics,
not merely because an SDK or smart-contract platform exists.

**Full Reference Wallet Day-0 Capability Target (added 2026-09-10,
Product Direction freeze — Gate B; existing product/reference-wallet
truth previously missing from this document's own network list, not new
scope invented on this date).** `@sails/adapter-ethers`'s "EVM family,
including BNB Smart Chain" line above named the family generically but
never enumerated it — the Satsails Wallet V2 reference target requires
USDT and/or USDC settlement across each of these individually-tracked
EVM networks: **Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum,
BNB Chain** — each with its own independent maturity/evidence/
eligibility state (shared implementation, if one is chosen, does not
imply shared maturity — see the architecture note in `docs/BACKLOG.md`
Cold Sweep Loop 5, item 20). USDT additionally targets Solana, Tron, TON,
and Liquid; USDC targets the six EVM networks above only (no Solana/Tron/
TON/Liquid claim for USDC at this time). BTC's Day-0 target spans five
distinct product capabilities — on-chain, Spark, Lightning, Arkade, and
Liquid/L-BTC — never collapsed into one another by shared implementation
(today's `LIGHTNING_HODL` provider is Ark-based; this does not make
Lightning and Arkade the same capability). DePix targets both Liquid and
Spark. XAUT (Tether Gold) targets Ethereum. None of this authorizes an
`AssetType` change, a new provider, or a settlement-architecture
decision — see `docs/BACKLOG.md`'s canonical matrix for the full,
authoritative, current version of this target.

## Months 1-3 — Foundation (Commitment)

- `@sails/protocol-spec` v0.1 published to npm (interfaces + event contracts only)
- API namespacing `/v1/{module}/` implemented across all restored/rebuilt routes
- Event namespacing `{module}.{entity}.{action}` fully applied (done in the
  reference implementation's event bus already — see `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- `moduleId` + `protocolVersion` fields in the database schema (done — see
  `DATABASE.md`)
- WDK real integration replacing the mock keypair flow
- Ed25519 auth middleware
- Lightning HODL escrow + Liquid covenant escrow (real implementations,
  replacing the `MockSettlementProvider`)

## Months 4-6 — Developer Adoption (Commitment)

- `@satsails/p2p-trading-sdk` v1.0 public — a real implementation of the `SailsClient`
  interface in `SDK_GUIDE.md`
- All 8 modules documented (spec + integration guide)
- Public sandbox testnet, no signup required
- First 10 wallet integrations using the SDK
- First-party adapter program underway for BDK, WDK, Breez SDK, Spark SDK,
  LDK, major EVM wallet-development stacks (including BNB Smart Chain), TRON,
  Solana, and TON; each adapter must be backed by real integration evidence
  before it is labeled supported
- Third-party security audit, scoped to Sails OpenP2P + Sails OpenSettlement
  (the two modules with real code as of this handoff)
- Sails OpenP2P module spec reaches v1.0 stability

## Months 7-9 — Intelligence Layer (Target)

- Sails OpenAgents: spec finalized + real QVAC SDK integration
- `AgentIntent` support — any module can receive delegated agent actions
- Sails OpenReputation made fully cross-module portable (usable outside
  OpenP2P)
- Sails OpenLiquidity network extended across multiple reference
  implementations (not just Satsails)
- Stacks + RSK escrow support added to Sails OpenSettlement

## Months 10-12 — Open Ecosystem (Aspirational)

- Sails OpenFinance: first module spec published (`LoanIntent`,
  `EarnIntent`, `SwapIntent`)
- Pears Runtime deployment — zero central server, fully P2P app
  distribution
- Hyperbee-based distributed order book (replacing today's centralized
  `InternalOrderBook`)
- 50+ wallet integrations
- Protocol governance layer v1
- Monorepo (`packages/protocol-spec`, `packages/sdk`,
  `apps/satsails-reference`) fully published
- `SDK_usecases.md` — the "family of named SDKs" (Trading, Settlement,
  Liquidity, Reputation, Policy, Agent — Breez-style, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
  §3's Named-SDK Rule) this phase would actually justify shipping.
  Written down now as a vision document, not built now — see that file
  for exactly what's real today vs. what this phase would need to build
  first (the Policy Engine's governed-rule system, most notably).
- **Third-Party Sails Modules & Developer Extension Ecosystem** —
  inspired by WDK Building Blocks and `create-wdk-module`
  (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`'s own "External Design Reference — WDK Building
  Blocks" section), Sails should eventually provide tooling for third
  parties to build Sails-compatible wallet adapters, settlement providers,
  and economic modules without requiring those technologies to become
  Core dependencies. Conceptually, not yet planned in implementation
  detail: `create-sails-adapter`, `create-sails-module`, scaffolding, a
  conformance harness, module templates, capability manifests,
  documentation templates, third-party wallet adapters, third-party
  settlement providers, and future third-party economic modules.
  **Package existence does not imply Sails support; conformance and
  evidence determine maturity** — the same discipline this document's own
  coverage matrix and First-Party Supported Criteria already apply to
  Sails' own first-party adapters (`README.md`). Named here as a future
  direction only — no scaffolding, registry, manifest schema, or tooling
  code exists yet, and none is authorized by this entry.

  **Cross-reference added 2026-09-14 (Post-Mission-4 Roadmap/Backlog
  Reconciliation) — this entry's own Aspirational/Months-10-12 status
  and content are otherwise unchanged.** This paragraph independently
  anticipated a shape now studied and frozen in detail elsewhere: Mission
  4 (`docs/ADAPTIVE_EXECUTION_CAPABILITY_ROUTING.md` §19.2) froze the
  eight-stage extension contract `External Capability → Public Contract →
  Capability Declaration → Constraints → Conformance → Evidence →
  Eligibility → Runtime Participation`; the External Extensibility
  Blind-Spot & Precedent Consolidation (`docs/EXTERNAL_EXTENSIBILITY_PRECEDENT_CONSOLIDATION.md`)
  independently studied WDK (this section's own inspiration) against real
  external-precedent evidence and reconciled it with Issue #152. Neither
  changes this entry's own Months-10-12/Aspirational placement or
  authorizes any implementation now — see `docs/BACKLOG.md` item 41 for
  the full reconciliation.
- **Third-Party Liquidity & Economic Modules** — a future track built on
  top of the extension ecosystem above, not a separate mechanism. External
  providers may contribute liquidity, RFQ, OTC, lending, swap, bridge,
  routing, and pricing capabilities through Sails-compatible modules.
  **Sails remains the coordination layer, does not own underlying capital
  or inventory, and may collect protocol fees from confirmed economic
  outcomes** subject to published policy and conformance — never from a
  module's mere existence or registration. `Sails OpenLiquidity` is a
  natural candidate for the first multi-provider third-party economic
  module ecosystem, since it already separates the coordination layer
  (`LiquidityProvider` interface, `InternalOrderBook`) from any specific
  liquidity source. **Integration should remain open. Economic
  coordination may be monetized. Module existence alone does not imply
  Sails support or production readiness** — the same
  package/module-existence ≠ supported ≠ production-ready rule the
  extension-ecosystem entry above and this document's own coverage matrix
  (`README.md`) already apply everywhere else. Named here as a future
  direction only — no module, provider registry, fee-collection mechanism,
  or conformance rule for third-party economic modules exists yet, and
  none is authorized by this entry.

## External Funding

Specific funding discussions, amounts, and counterparties are intentionally
not disclosed in this public document — internal only, and not finalized.
The Months 1-3/4-6/7-9/10-12 phases above stand on their own regardless of
external funding outcomes: `PROTOCOL_ECONOMY.md` §3 (**revised 2026-08-11**)
has the Protocol Fee active from launch, independent of whether any
external funding is secured, so the roadmap does not depend on a specific
grant landing to fund engineering, security, SDK work, or operations.

## What Is Already Done vs. What Remains

Do not present the roadmap above as starting from zero. As of this handoff:

- Sails OpenP2P core logic (Trade lifecycle, escrow state machine, liquidity
  routing) already exists as real code — see `ARCHITECTURE.md` section 4
- Event bus namespacing is already fixed (`{module}.{entity}.{action}`)
- Database schema already has `moduleId`/`protocolVersion`
- The P2P transport layer already correctly supports multiple concurrent
  users (`PearNode`/`PearNodeRegistry` — see `NODE_ARCHITECTURE.md`)

For current unresolved engineering obligations, use `BACKLOG.md` and the live GitHub Issues/Project as the primary operational sources. `TODO.md` is retained as an audited historical/category-oriented implementation-gap inventory with limited authority and may contain resolved or superseded material. Do not infer current remaining work from this roadmap or `TODO.md` alone.

## Optional Future Infrastructure — Sails-operated OTS Aggregator / Calendar

**Status: OPTIONAL / FUTURE — not a Day-0 dependency.**

Day 0 uses OpenTimestamps behind the Sails-owned TimestampAnchor abstraction with multiple public, free OpenTimestamps calendars for availability redundancy. No individual calendar is Protocol Truth, Economic Authority, or a required dependency for Sails economic-state progression.

If operational evidence later justifies it, Sails may operate an OpenTimestamps-compatible aggregator/calendar as **one additional availability option** within the same open ecosystem. Such infrastructure MUST NOT become the mandatory calendar, a central timestamp authority, an interoperability gate, or a prerequisite for OpenProof/Sails economic availability.

This roadmap item does not replace the Day-0 multi-calendar requirement recorded in docs/BACKLOG.md; it deliberately keeps Sails-operated timestamp infrastructure outside the Day-0 critical path.

## Open Extension — External Market Interoperability / Market Bridges

**Status: OPTIONAL / FUTURE — architectural openness, not a Day-0 dependency.**

> **Open Extension. Stable semantics. Governed compatibility.**
>
> **Any team may plug capabilities into Sails. No integration may redefine Sails economic meaning.**

Sails should preserve stable extension boundaries through which independent teams can connect wallets, P2P marketplaces, exchanges, liquidity sources, nodes, agents, settlement capabilities, and future economic systems without requiring those systems to surrender their own application architecture, custody model, identity model, settlement model, or governance.

External Market Interoperability is a future application of the broader **Open Extension** principle. A future `MarketBridge` or equivalent compatible interface may expose only the capabilities an external system actually supports — for example discovery/liquidity, offers, contracts/orders, messaging, settlement coordination, evidence, identity signals, or reputation signals. Interoperability MUST be capability-scoped rather than inferred from the existence of a connection.

Canonical boundaries:

- Open Extension expands capabilities at the edges; it MUST NOT redefine Sails economic states, commitments, authorities, transitions, or canonical semantics.
- External state reachable through a bridge does not become native Sails Protocol Truth merely because Sails can observe or coordinate with it.
- Provenance and authority MUST remain explicit. External offers, contracts, identity signals, evidence, reputation, liquidity, and settlement remain attributable to their originating system and authority model.
- `MarketBridge ≠ native Sails market participant ≠ Protocol Truth ≠ Economic Authority`.
- External market sovereignty MUST be preserved: interoperability does not require an external market to adopt Sails internal product architecture.
- Sails Market is a first-party/reference application, not a privileged protocol gateway. Compatible independent applications and bridges are governed by the same protocol capabilities and conformance boundaries.
- Bridge implementations MAY be produced by Sails, the external ecosystem itself, or independent third parties. Compatibility depends on explicit interfaces, capabilities, conformance, and security requirements — not organizational ownership.

Strategic consequence:

> **Application competitors can become protocol participants.**

Sails therefore does not require existing markets to disappear for an open interoperable P2P economic network to emerge. Independent markets may remain competitors or sovereign products at the application layer while participating, where technically and economically compatible, in Sails-coordinated liquidity and market activity at the protocol edge.

This item intentionally does **not** name any external marketplace as a required integration and does not claim compatibility with any current third-party platform. Specific bridges require separate research, specification, conformance evidence, security review, and explicit implementation owners before they can move beyond roadmap status.

Relationship to existing extension surfaces: the architectural pattern is analogous to the existing separation of Wallet Adapter contracts, Settlement Providers, connectors, and other capability boundaries: **Sails defines stable interfaces and invariants; replaceable edge implementations supply capabilities without acquiring authority to redefine the economic center.**
