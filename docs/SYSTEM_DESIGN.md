# Sails Protocol — System Design

> **Status:** Draft / CTO-owned consolidation.  
> **Purpose:** This document is the technical entry point to the current Sails system. It summarizes the architecture and routes readers to the canonical normative and specialized documents. It does **not** replace ADRs, RFCs, the Semantic Kernel, the protocol specification, or implementation evidence.

---

## 1. What this document is

Sails has accumulated substantial architecture, implementation, security, lifecycle, authority, provider, SDK and institutional documentation. The problem is no longer lack of technical material; it is that a new engineer must currently reconstruct the system across many documents and historical handoffs.

This document provides one coherent system-level view.

Use it to answer:

- what Sails is;
- where protocol truth lives;
- how the software layers relate;
- how a P2P economic interaction flows end to end;
- where authority, evidence, settlement and recovery boundaries live;
- which parts are protocol semantics versus Reference Implementation choices;
- which deeper document owns each topic.

### Source-of-truth rule

When this document summarizes a deeper normative source, the deeper source wins.

In particular:

- semantic identity → [SEMANTIC_KERNEL.md](SEMANTIC_KERNEL.md)
- Pure Core architecture → [CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md](CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- implementation derivation → [CORE_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md](CORE_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- protocol primitives/conformance → [PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md](PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md)
- protocol invariants → [PROTOCOL_INVARIANTS.md](PROTOCOL_INVARIANTS.md)
- architectural decisions → [adr/](adr/)
- accepted design decisions / detailed mechanisms → [rfcs/](rfcs/)
- current engineering obligations → [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)
- release / future sequencing → [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)

---

## 2. System identity

**Current category:** Sails Protocol is an **Economic Coordination Protocol**.

**V1 focus:** open infrastructure for building interoperable P2P Financial Marketplaces.

**First concrete developer product:** **Sails P2P Trading SDK**.

The shortest useful mental model remains:

```text
User → Intent → Coordination → Settlement → Completion
```

Sails does not require one wallet stack, one settlement network, one transport, one database, one application, or one operator to define economic meaning.

The protocol coordinates shared semantics while implementations remain replaceable.

---

## 3. Architecture at a glance

The current software macro-architecture is:

```text
Semantic Kernel
      ↓
Pure Core
      ↓
Runtime
      ↓
Modules
      ↓
Providers / Adapters
      ↓
Applications / Interfaces
```

### 3.1 Semantic Kernel

The Semantic Kernel defines the minimum properties that must remain true for an interaction to still be recognizably governed by Sails.

It is **not a package** and is not identical to `@sails/core`.

Canonical owner: [SEMANTIC_KERNEL.md](SEMANTIC_KERNEL.md).

### 3.2 Pure Core

The Pure Core materializes Sails' economic semantics without owning infrastructure, persistence, transport, provider implementation or application concerns.

The current TypeScript implementation surface is the internal/private `packages/sails-core/` workspace.

Canonical owners:

- [CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md](CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [CORE_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md](CORE_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md)

### 3.3 Runtime

Runtime turns pure semantics into executable system behavior. It owns orchestration concerns such as persistence boundaries, event processing, transactions, recovery coordination and invocation of Pure Core semantics.

Runtime is not protocol truth by itself.

### 3.4 Modules

Current responsibilities are organized into modules such as:

- OpenP2P
- OpenSettlement
- OpenIdentity
- OpenReputation
- OpenProof
- OpenLiquidity
- OpenAgents
- OpenFinance where roadmap scope applies

Modules coordinate domain responsibilities; they do not redefine the Semantic Kernel.

### 3.5 Providers and adapters

Providers translate stable Sails semantics into replaceable external mechanisms.

Examples include:

- wallet adapters;
- settlement providers;
- transport providers;
- evidence providers;
- arbitration providers;
- liquidity providers.

A provider may change how something executes. It may not change what the authorized economic outcome means.

### 3.6 Applications and interfaces

Applications consume Sails without owning protocol semantics.

Important first-party surfaces include:

- **Sails Market** — first-party/reference commercial web marketplace surface;
- **Satsails Wallet** — first-party wallet/reference integration and validation surface;
- third-party wallets, services and professional liquidity providers.

Reference application control does not imply protocol control.

---

## 4. Protocol versus Reference Implementation

This distinction is mandatory.

### Protocol / specification

Technology-independent rules, interfaces, semantics, invariants and conformance behavior.

The protocol does not inherently depend on:

- TypeScript;
- PostgreSQL;
- Redis;
- Prisma;
- Fastify;
- Pears/HyperDHT;
- a particular blockchain;
- Satsails infrastructure.

### TypeScript Reference Implementation

The current repository contains a concrete implementation using technologies including TypeScript and a PostgreSQL/Prisma-based persistence stack.

Those technologies prove and exercise the protocol. They are not themselves protocol requirements.

A conformant independent implementation in another language or persistence stack must be able to preserve the same economic meaning.

---

## 5. End-to-end P2P economic flow

At system level, the intended journey is approximately:

```text
Participant
  ↓
Intent
  ↓
Discovery / Offer
  ↓
Negotiation
  ↓
Agreed economic terms
  ↓
Trade
  ↓
Settlement / Escrow
  ↓
Payment / Evidence
  ↓
Release | Refund | Dispute
  ↓
Economic Outcome
  ↓
Reputation / Accounting / Completion projections
```

This is an architectural orientation, not a replacement for the concrete state machines or route/API documentation.

Relevant deeper sources:

- protocol primitives → [PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md](PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md)
- application-facing APIs → [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md)
- frozen SDK contract → [API_STABLE.md](API_STABLE.md)
- current lifecycle obligations → [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)

---

## 6. State, lifecycle and economic truth

Sails distinguishes:

```text
state snapshot ≠ complete economic truth
```

and:

```text
economic state ≠ transport/event arrival order
```

State transitions must respect canonical lifecycle rules and authority at the moment that matters economically.

Important cross-cutting rules include:

- delayed or reordered events must not regress newer economic state;
- retry permission does not create new authority;
- UNKNOWN must not be collapsed into FAILED;
- historical authority must not silently remain executable after supersession;
- external provider acceptance is not automatically final economic truth.

Detailed state/lifecycle findings and accepted remediations belong to their dedicated discovery documents, ADRs and issues rather than being redefined here.

---

## 7. Authority model

Sails deliberately separates several concepts that are commonly conflated:

```text
Authentication ≠ Authorization
Identity ≠ Authority
Recommendation ≠ Authority
Execution Authority ≠ Economic Disposition Authority
Economic Disposition Authority ≠ Destination Authority
Past Authority ≠ Current Authority
```

Authority must be checked at the correct economic boundary, not merely at an outer HTTP route or earlier step.

Key current architecture:

- authenticated identity establishes who is calling;
- role/economic-scope checks establish whether that actor may perform a specific action;
- capability grants do not create economic consent;
- disputed economic disposition is generation-bound;
- settlement execution must not silently survive a superseding ruling;
- destination authority remains beneficiary-controlled where required.

Detailed authority architecture is owned by the authority discovery material and relevant ADRs.

---

## 8. Evidence and OpenProof

Evidence is a protocol input and provenance surface, not automatic truth.

Preserve:

```text
Evidence bytes ≠ Evidence truth
Evidence availability ≠ Evidence integrity
Authentication ≠ Evidence Authorization
Valid signature ≠ authority to attach evidence anywhere
```

Current direction:

- OpenProof is the integrity-bound path for real media/file evidence;
- lightweight external/non-file dispute references may remain separate;
- production evidence storage must be durable, private, multi-instance-safe and provider-neutral;
- storage-provider choice must not become protocol semantics.

Canonical architecture owner for the active production-hardening work is Issue #234 and its bounded implementation owners.

---

## 9. Settlement architecture

Sails expresses the destination of an economic settlement using:

```text
Asset + SettlementRail
```

These are separate product dimensions.

Examples of settlement mechanisms vary by rail:

- Bitcoin L1 may use script/multisig-style mechanisms;
- Spark uses Spark-specific primitives;
- Arkade uses Ark/vTXO-specific mechanisms;
- EVM-family rails use contract/account-abstraction mechanisms;
- Solana, TRON, TON and Liquid require rail-specific implementations.

The protocol defines settlement capability and economic semantics, not one universal escrow mechanism.

Preserve:

```text
Asset ≠ SettlementRail ≠ Wallet Adapter ≠ Settlement Provider
Implementation exists ≠ Production eligible
```

Canonical decision: ADR-002 and the relevant provider documentation.

---

## 10. Wallet adapter architecture

Wallet integrations are replaceable edges.

Sails defines a stable wallet-adapter contract rather than defining protocol support as a list of SDK brands.

Preserve:

```text
WalletAdapter ≠ SettlementProvider ≠ External Wallet Connector
```

A wallet adapter exposes capabilities needed by Sails while the wallet retains custody, key ownership and signing responsibility.

Satsails Wallet is an important first-party/reference integration, not the definition of the protocol.

---

## 11. Events, durability and projections

Sails uses event-driven module coordination to reduce cross-module ownership violations.

However:

```text
event persisted ≠ all downstream projections completed
notification ≠ protocol state
```

Durable event history, delivery/fanout and durable projection completion are distinct concerns.

The reference runtime must recover safely across:

- crash after durable event persistence;
- partial projection application;
- duplicate delivery;
- process restart;
- multi-instance execution.

Current production-hardening work tracks these properties explicitly rather than assuming that an emitted event proves convergence.

---

## 12. Persistence and reference runtime

The current TypeScript Reference Implementation uses PostgreSQL with Prisma for durable application/runtime persistence, with Redis used in selected runtime/distribution roles.

This is implementation architecture, not protocol truth.

The system must preserve the distinction:

```text
database state ≠ protocol definition
runtime persistence ≠ semantic authority
```

Recovery and consistency requirements must remain expressible independently of the chosen storage technology.

---

## 13. Multi-node / network topology

Day-0 must not collapse into one mandatory Satsails-controlled backend.

Required direction:

- multiple independent Sails node/runtime operators;
- shared economic network rather than isolated liquidity islands;
- node selection should be service-level choice, not market membership;
- bootstrap/discovery infrastructure must not become protocol authority.

Core property:

```text
Node choice must not define market membership.
Liquidity should be network-level; node operation should be service-level.
```

Canonical architecture owner: ADR-001 and Issue #105 for completion/evidence.

---

## 14. Identity and reputation

Sails coordinates economic participants; it does not require one universal public identity provider.

Identity, transport identity, wallet keys and reputation portability are separate concerns.

Current design direction preserves interoperability with multiple identity/reputation mechanisms while avoiding a privileged identity backend becoming protocol authority.

Reputation must remain evidence/provenance-based and portable enough not to become trapped by a single node or application.

---

## 15. AI / agent boundary

AI may assist Sails engineering and runtime behavior, but:

```text
Intelligence ≠ Authority
Inference ≠ Evidence
Model confidence ≠ protocol truth
Agent access ≠ Agent authority
```

QVAC or any other model may recommend, classify, reason or propose only within explicit capabilities and authority boundaries.

A model change must not redefine economic semantics.

Canonical owner for this architectural boundary: Issue #155 and the relevant OpenAgents/QVAC documents.

---

## 16. Security and production-readiness model

**Current status:** the reference implementation is still inside Day-0 / production-readiness hardening and must not be described as production-open yet. Production eligibility remains a governed gate, not a property inferred from code existence or green CI.

Sails treats implementation, evidence and production eligibility as separate claims.

Examples:

```text
Protocol-representable ≠ Runtime-registered ≠ Deployment-eligible
Provider implementation ≠ Provider maturity ≠ Production eligibility
CI green ≠ architecture correct
Internal test success ≠ external reality proof
```

Production gates require explicit evidence for:

- authorization boundaries;
- crash/restart recovery;
- concurrency;
- provider ambiguity / UNKNOWN;
- multi-instance behavior;
- storage durability;
- rail-specific recovery;
- real partner integration;
- multi-operator network behavior;
- Red Team/security validation;
- external/live provider evidence where claimed.

---

## 17. Product and UI boundary

Protocol truth is upstream of product presentation.

Preserve:

```text
Protocol defines truth. UI represents truth.
Economic State Before Interface State.
Recommendation ≠ decision.
Ruling ≠ Settlement.
Unknown ≠ Failure.
```

The design-system/UI work is intentionally governed separately and must consume current protocol/SDK truth rather than invent lifecycle or authority semantics.

---

## 18. Documentation authority tiers

The repository intentionally preserves both current truth and the evidence/history that produced it. They are not the same class of document.

### Tier A — primary technical path

`README → PROJECT_CONTEXT → SYSTEM_DESIGN → Semantic Kernel/Core → Protocol Specification/Invariants → ADR/RFC → API/SDK → Backlog/Roadmap`

### Tier B — specialized current references

Examples include database, deployment, node architecture, trust boundary, cryptographic model, security/threat model, protocol economy and provider/rail-specific safety documents.

### Tier C — discovery / audit / evidence records

Discovery, cold-sweep, conformance, cross-layer and technical-debt reports preserve evidence and decision provenance. They do not automatically remain the owner of current architecture after their findings are consumed by canonical architecture, ADRs or RFCs.

### Tier D — historical / handoff / limited-authority material

Historical handoffs, superseded sections and resolved operational inventories remain traceable but should not sit in the primary reader path.

This classification is about **authority and navigation**, not deleting history.

---

## 19. Current technical reading path

For a new engineer:

1. [../README.md](../README.md) — repository/product orientation
2. [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) — institutional/product context
3. **SYSTEM_DESIGN.md** — system-level technical map
4. [SEMANTIC_KERNEL.md](SEMANTIC_KERNEL.md) — semantic identity
5. [CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md](CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md) — modern Core boundary
6. [CORE_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md](CORE_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md) — implementation derivation
7. [PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md](PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md) — primitives and conformance
8. [adr/](adr/) and [../rfcs/](rfcs/) — decisions and detailed mechanisms
9. [API_STABLE.md](API_STABLE.md), [SDK_GUIDE.md](SDK_GUIDE.md), [API_REFERENCE.md](API_REFERENCE.md) — integration surface
10. [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) — current obligations and sequencing

---

## 20. Documentation architecture cleanup

The repository still contains substantial historical "Engineering Handoff · Document X of 20" framing.

That material contains valuable provenance, but it should not remain the primary navigation model.

The target information architecture is:

```text
README
  ↓
PROJECT_CONTEXT
  ↓
SYSTEM_DESIGN
  ├── Semantic Kernel / Core
  ├── Protocol Specification
  ├── ADRs / RFCs
  ├── Specialized architecture/security/recovery docs
  └── API / SDK docs
```

Historical and superseded documents should remain traceable but be clearly labeled and moved out of the primary mental path where appropriate.

---

## 21. Status of this draft

This first version intentionally consolidates already-established repository truth.

It does **not** freeze new architecture.

Before merge it still requires:

- full documentation inventory;
- contradiction/staleness sweep;
- verification of every deep link;
- reconciliation with current ADR/RFC index;
- confirmation against active Day-0 hardening owners;
- explicit CTO Gate.
