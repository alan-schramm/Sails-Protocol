# RFC-018: Intent as the Canonical Entry Point for Every Trade

## Summary

Today, `Intent`/`IntentEvent` (`core/intent-engine.ts`) and OpenP2P's
`Offer`/`Trade` (`liquidity.service.ts`, `trade.service.ts`) are two
fully separate, unconnected code paths — no real `Offer` or `Trade` has
an `Intent` row behind it, despite `PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` §1.11
already stating that a published `Offer` "is OpenLiquidity's concrete
database artifact representing a published, discoverable Intent." This
RFC makes that claim true: every `Offer` is created *from* a real
`TradeIntent`, and every `Trade` references the `Intent` that produced
it. The Intent Engine becomes the single owner of the intention's
lifecycle (creation, validation, expiration); OpenP2P's `Trade` becomes
purely the materialized agreement once negotiation concludes — it never
duplicates lifecycle logic Intent already owns.

**Status:** Accepted. Triggered by a project-owner-relayed CTO-role
review that first flagged a documentation gap ("Intent não está no
centro"), which a code-level fidelity audit then corrected in the
opposite direction — Intent *is* already the 2nd primitive,
fully specified, but the real Offer/Trade code path never calls it. The
CTO review's follow-up response approved this as a P0 architecture item
("ARC-001" in that review; renumbered here to stay in this project's
single, permanent RFC sequence — see `GOVERNANCE.md` §5's "numbered,
sequential, never reused" rule, itself part of what this consolidation
effort has been enforcing). Bypasses the Discussion window
(`GOVERNANCE.md` §5), the same precedent RFC-007/RFC-015/RFC-016/RFC-017
already used for owner-directed RFCs.

**Classification:** Core RFC (`GOVERNANCE.md` §6A) — changes which code
path is the canonical entry point for `Trade`, a lifecycle-wiring
change to an existing primitive, not an additive one.

## Motivation

A concrete, present-day consequence of the gap: an SDK consumer calling
`@sails/sdk`'s `createIntent()` today gets a real, persisted `Intent`
with zero relationship to any actual P2P trade they might separately
start via `POST /v1/openp2p/trades`. Nothing lets that consumer answer
"what happened to my Intent?" — the audit trail `parentIntentId`
composability (§2.2) is explicitly designed for, and the whole reason
`AgentIntent`-driven flows need a traceable decision tree, cannot exist
while `Offer`/`Trade` sit outside the Intent lifecycle entirely.

This also means `PRINCIPLES.md` Principle 2 ("Intent Driven" — "lets
humans, wallets, and AI agents all speak the protocol the same way ...
never a direct API call") is currently violated by the one real trade
flow this codebase ships: `trade.routes.ts`'s `POST
/v1/openp2p/trades` is exactly the "direct, action-specific API call"
that principle says shouldn't be the starting point.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Eliminate `Intent`/`IntentEvent`, keep `Offer`/`Trade` as the only
  real model.** Rejected — this is what the code accidentally does
  today, and it's the thing being fixed, not adopted. It would also
  mean deleting real, tested, working code (`intent-engine.ts`'s
  `create()`/`cancel()`/`transition()`, the hash-chained `IntentEvent`
  audit trail) to paper over a wiring gap.
- **Eliminate `Offer`/`Trade`, route everything through raw `Intent`.**
  Rejected — `Trade` carries OpenP2P-specific fields (`buyerId`,
  `sellerId`, escrow relationship) the generic `Intent.payload: Json`
  blob was never meant to model directly, and `PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md`
  §3.1 already establishes the pattern every application module should
  follow: a module-specific lifecycle refinement that maps back onto
  the generic one, never a parallel top-level lifecycle. `Trade` is
  OpenP2P's refinement; it should reference its originating `Intent`,
  not replace it.
- **Make `Offer` optional but `intentId` mandatory on `Trade` only,
  skip linking `Offer`.** Considered, rejected: `Offer` is the
  *discoverable, public* form of a `TradeIntent` — leaving it
  unlinked would mean Discovery (§1.3) still can't answer "which
  Intent does this candidate satisfy," reproducing the same gap one
  layer later.

## Decision

Every `Offer` gains a nullable `intentId` foreign key to `Intent`.
`liquidity.service.ts`'s `createOffer()` calls `intentEngine.create()`
first (with `type: 'TradeIntent'`, deriving `TradeIntentPayload` from
the `CreateOfferInput` fields it already receives — `asset`, `side`,
`fiatMethod: input.paymentMethod`, `network`, and a `maxValue`/
`minValue` pair derived from `priceUsd × maxAmount`/`minAmount`), then
persists the `Offer` row with the resulting `intentId`.

Every `Trade` gains a nullable `intentId` foreign key, copied from the
accepted `Offer`. **Corrected during implementation (2026-07-19) from
this RFC's original draft:** `createTrade()` does **not** transition
straight to `COMMITTED` — `assertValidTransition` (`core/state-machine.ts`)
does not allow `COORDINATED → COMMITTED` directly, and
`PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` §3.1's own, already-accepted mapping table
places `COMMITTED` at "05 ESCROW LOCKED," not at trade creation ("02
COUNTERPARTY FOUND"). `createTrade()` instead walks the Intent through
`DISCOVERING → MATCHED → NEGOTIATING` (the search that led here, the
counterparty being found, and `negotiationService.open()` all happening
synchronously in this reference implementation's "accept an offer"
flow) — real, scoped engineering work, not a documentation fix.
`COMMITTED` fires from `common/events/handlers.ts`'s
`settlement.escrow.locked` reaction instead, matching §3.1 exactly.
When settlement completes, the existing `settlement.escrow.released`
reaction walks `SETTLING → FULFILLED`; `settlement.escrow.refunded`
transitions directly to `FAILED` (valid from both `COMMITTED` and
`SETTLING` per the state machine, so no need to track which one the
Intent is in at refund time).

**Also corrected during implementation:** the ownership-check change
flagged in Implementation Impact below turned out unnecessary —
`intent-engine.ts`'s exported `transition()` has no ownership check at
all (only `cancel()` does); it was already designed as an open
mechanism any module can drive with any `triggeredBy` string, per its
own doc comment. Verified by reading the function before assuming a
change was needed, not by trial and error.

`IntentHandler` (§2.7)'s real implementation
(`OpenP2PTradeIntentHandler`, formalizing the inline `TradeIntent`
validation `intent-engine.ts` currently does directly) remains
deferred — Phase 3, not built in this pass (see Reference
Implementation Plan).

## Implementation Impact

**Status: implemented 2026-07-19** (`npm run build` clean, `npm test`
212/212 — 5 new tests). What actually changed, corrected from the
original plan below where implementation found a better path:

- `prisma/schema.prisma` — `Offer` and `Trade` each gained a nullable
  `intentId String?` column + relation to `Intent` (`Intent` gained
  back-relation arrays `offers`/`trades`). **Schema edited and
  `npx prisma generate` run; no live Postgres available in this
  environment to run `prisma migrate dev`/`db push` against — a real
  deployment needs to apply this schema change before this code path
  will work.**
- `src/modules/open-liquidity/liquidity.service.ts` — `createOffer()`
  calls `intentEngine.create()` before `prisma.offer.create()`, exactly
  as planned.
- `src/modules/open-p2p/trade.service.ts` — `createTrade()` copies
  `offer.intentId` onto the new `Trade` row and walks
  `DISCOVERING → MATCHED → NEGOTIATING` (not straight to `COMMITTED` —
  see Decision's correction above).
- `src/common/events/handlers.ts` — `settlement.escrow.locked` gained
  the `COMMITTED` transition; `settlement.escrow.released` gained
  `SETTLING` then `FULFILLED`; `settlement.escrow.refunded` gained
  `FAILED`. New module-level `INTENT_LIFECYCLE_TRIGGER` constant
  (`'system:trade-lifecycle'`), matching the existing
  `'system:expiry-check'` sentinel convention.
- `src/core/intent-engine.ts` — **not changed.** The planned ownership-
  check adjustment was found unnecessary on inspection (see Decision).
- `src/modules/open-p2p/intent-handler.ts` (`OpenP2PTradeIntentHandler`)
  — **not built.** Phase 3, still deferred.
- New tests: `tests/routes.test.ts` (offer-publish and trade-creation
  HTTP round-trips now assert the Intent chain fires) and
  `tests/reputationOutcome.test.ts` (a new describe block asserting
  each `settlement.escrow.*` handler drives the right transition, and
  that a pre-RFC-018 Trade with `intentId: null` is skipped cleanly).

**Core RFC Review Checklist** (`GOVERNANCE.md` §6A):

- [x] `PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` — updated (§1.11's `Offer` entry,
  §1.12's footnote).
- [ ] `PROTOCOL_INVARIANTS.md` — not applicable. No Constitutional or
  Operational invariant changes; the Intent/Trade link is a wiring fix,
  not a custody or trust-boundary change.
- [ ] `TRUST_BOUNDARY.md` — not applicable, same reason.
- [ ] `SECURITY_MODEL.md` — not applicable, same reason.
- [ ] `CRYPTOGRAPHIC_MODEL.md` — not applicable, same reason.

## Primitives Used or Extended

Extends **Intent** (§1.2, §2) and **Discovery** (§1.3, via `Offer`'s new
`intentId`). No new primitive — this operationalizes a relationship
§1.11 already asserts conceptually but the code has never built.

## Principle Alignment

- **Principle 2, Intent Driven** — directly restored. Today's gap is
  the one live violation of this principle in the shipped code; this
  RFC's whole purpose is closing it.
- **Principle 9, Interface Agnostic** — unaffected. `Trade`'s existing
  shape is unchanged except for the additive `intentId` column; no UI
  or SDK-facing contract needs to change to keep working (a caller that
  never looks at `intentId` sees no difference).

## Specification

```prisma
model Offer {
  // ...existing fields unchanged...
  intentId String?
  intent   Intent? @relation(fields: [intentId], references: [id])
}

model Trade {
  // ...existing fields unchanged...
  intentId String?
  intent   Intent? @relation(fields: [intentId], references: [id])
}
```

```typescript
// liquidity.service.ts
async createOffer(input: CreateOfferInput) {
  const intent = await intentEngine.create('TradeIntent', {
    asset: input.asset,
    side: input.side,
    maxValue: Number(input.priceUsd) * Number(input.maxAmount),
    minValue: Number(input.priceUsd) * Number(input.minAmount),
    fiatMethod: input.paymentMethod,
    network: input.network,
  }, input.userId)

  const offer = await prisma.offer.create({
    data: { /* ...existing fields..., */ intentId: intent.id },
  })
  // ...existing event emission unchanged...
}

// trade.service.ts
async createTrade(input: CreateTradeInput) {
  const offer = await prisma.offer.findUnique({ where: { id: input.offerId } })
  // ...existing validation unchanged...
  const trade = await prisma.trade.create({
    data: { /* ...existing fields..., */ intentId: offer.intentId },
  })
  if (offer.intentId) {
    const triggeredBy = 'system:trade-lifecycle'
    await intentEngine.transition(offer.intentId, 'DISCOVERING', triggeredBy, 'intent.discovering', { intentId: offer.intentId })
    await intentEngine.transition(offer.intentId, 'MATCHED', triggeredBy, 'intent.matched', { intentId: offer.intentId, candidateIds: [input.counterpartyId] })
    await intentEngine.transition(offer.intentId, 'NEGOTIATING', triggeredBy, 'intent.negotiating', { intentId: offer.intentId, negotiationId: trade.id })
  }
  // ...existing event emission + negotiationService.open() unchanged...
}

// common/events/handlers.ts — settlement.escrow.locked
eventBus.on('settlement.escrow.locked', async (payload) => {
  const trade = await prisma.trade.update({ where: { id: payload.tradeId }, data: { status: 'ACTIVE' } })
  if (trade.intentId) {
    await intentEngine.transition(trade.intentId, 'COMMITTED', INTENT_LIFECYCLE_TRIGGER, 'intent.committed',
      { intentId: trade.intentId, settlementId: payload.escrowId, terms: null })
  }
})
```

**No `intent-engine.ts` change was needed** — `transition()` (as
opposed to `cancel()`) has no ownership check at all; it's an open
mechanism any module can drive with any `triggeredBy` string, by
design (its own doc comment). The original draft assumed a change was
needed here without having re-read the function first; corrected once
it was.

## Backward Compatibility

No `protocolVersion` bump — `intentId` is additive and nullable on both
tables, same pattern RFC-008 used for `entryHash`/`prevHash`. Existing
`Offer`/`Trade` rows keep `intentId: null` and remain fully valid;
`Timeline`/reputation/dispute code that reads `Trade`/`Offer` today
needs no change, since nothing currently reads `intentId` off either
table.

## Reference Implementation Plan

Satsails reference implementation (this repo).

**Phases 1-2 — done (2026-07-19).** Schema (`Offer`/`Trade` gain
nullable `intentId`), `createOffer()`/`createTrade()` wired as
specified, and the full `DISCOVERING → MATCHED → NEGOTIATING →
COMMITTED → SETTLING → FULFILLED`/`FAILED` lifecycle driven from
`trade.service.ts` and the three `settlement.escrow.*` reactions in
`common/events/handlers.ts` — landed together as one real engineering
pass, not left provisional, once the target was registered and clearly
understood (per the CTO review's own instruction: register and plan
first, then this pass is the "implementation" step, not a second
provisional fix layered on top). `intent-engine.ts` needed no change
(see Decision). Verified: `npm run build` clean, `npm test` 212/212 (5
new tests). **Not yet applied to a live database** — no Postgres
reachable in this environment; the schema change needs
`npx prisma migrate dev` (or `db push`, matching whichever this
project's real deployment uses — no `prisma/migrations/` directory
exists in this repo to indicate which) run against a real database
before this code path works outside tests.

**Phase 3 — `OpenP2PTradeIntentHandler`** — remains deferred. Extracting
`intent-engine.ts`'s inline `TradeIntent` validation into a real,
registered `IntentHandler` (§2.7) is a refactor of already-working
logic, not a gap Phases 1-2 depend on — left for a future pass.
