### Sails Protocol — Engineering Handoff · Document 3 of 20

> Schema lives at `prisma/schema.prisma` in the Satsails reference
> implementation. PostgreSQL is the reference implementation's choice — the
> protocol itself does not mandate any specific database (see
> `ARCHITECTURE.md` section 1).

## 1. The `moduleId` / `protocolVersion` Pattern (read this before touching the schema)

Every entity that belongs to a specific protocol module carries two fields:

```prisma
moduleId        String  @default("openp2p")     // which module owns this row
protocolVersion String  @default("0.1")          // which spec version created it
```

**Why:** without `moduleId`, when Sails OpenFinance ships in the future and
needs its own trades/offers/escrows, you'd either need new tables (duplicate
schema) or ambiguous shared tables. With `moduleId`, `OpenFinance` rows and
`OpenP2P` rows can coexist in the same `trades` table, cleanly distinguished
by a `WHERE moduleId = 'openfinance'` filter.

`protocolVersion` exists so that, as the Sails Protocol Spec evolves (e.g.
`0.1` → `0.2` changes the shape of an event payload), you can tell which
version's rules applied when a given row was created — critical for
long-lived data and for debugging disputes.

**Rule:** any new entity you add to this schema must include both fields, set
to the correct module's canonical name (see the module list in
`ARCHITECTURE.md` section 3) and the current spec version.

## 2. Enums

```prisma
enum AssetType {
  BTC
  USDT_ERC20
  USDT_TRC20
  USDT_LIQUID
  USDT_LIGHTNING
  LN_BTC
  LIQUID_BTC
  SPARK
  STACKS
  RSK_BTC
}
```

**Consciously unsupported for real escrow, 2026-08-01 (multisig-coverage-per-asset
audit)** — a real product decision, not an oversight: of the 10 values above,
only `BTC` (`MULTISIG`) and `LN_BTC` (`LIGHTNING_HODL`) have a genuinely
non-custodial provider today; `USDT_ERC20` has real on-chain execution but
single-seed custody (`WDK_USDT_EVM`). `USDT_TRC20`, `USDT_LIQUID`,
`USDT_LIGHTNING`, `LIQUID_BTC`, `SPARK`, `STACKS`, `RSK_BTC` have no real
`SettlementProvider` wired at all — `recommendedEscrowType()`
(`escrow.service.ts`) throws a clear error for any of them rather than
guessing or silently falling back to `MOCK`. Deliberately left in the enum
(not removed) — the values themselves are real and correct, only escrow
custody for them is unbuilt. Revisit when a real provider exists for one
of them (`LIQUID_COVENANT` below is the natural candidate for
`LIQUID_BTC`/`USDT_LIQUID` specifically).

```prisma
enum TradeSide {
  BUY
  SELL
}

enum OfferStatus {
  ACTIVE
  PAUSED
  COMPLETED
  CANCELLED
}

enum TradeStatus {
  PENDING
  ACTIVE
  COMPLETED
  DISPUTED
  CANCELLED
}

enum EscrowType {
  MULTISIG
  LIGHTNING_HODL
  LIQUID_COVENANT  // reserved, zero implementation since this value was first added — a real product decision (2026-08-01 multisig-coverage-per-asset audit), not an oversight. No LiquidCovenantProvider exists; getProvider() (escrow.service.ts) refuses to silently fall back to MOCK for it, same as any other unregistered real type. Natural candidate for LIQUID_BTC/USDT_LIQUID once someone builds it — not currently planned or scheduled.
  WDK_USDT_EVM  // real @tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm USDT (ERC-20) settlement — see wdk-settlement.provider.ts. Missing here until a 2026-07-19 consolidation audit caught this file drifting from the real schema.
  MOCK
}

enum EscrowStatus {
  CREATED
  FUNDS_LOCKED
  PAYMENT_PENDING
  COMPLETED
  DISPUTED
  REFUNDED
  SPLIT  // RFC-021 D9 (2026-08-02) — only reachable from DISPUTED; a real settlement action now exists for MOCK/WDK_USDT_EVM/MULTISIG (see that RFC's own D9 section for why SAFE_GUARD_EVM/LIGHTNING_HODL can't support it)
}
```

**`PENDING_BANK_SETTLEMENT` (RFC-007 D3) is designed, not implemented.**
A 2026-07-19 consolidation audit found this file — along with
`PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md`, `API_REFERENCE.md`, and `SDK_GUIDE.md` —
documenting `PENDING_BANK_SETTLEMENT` as a real `EscrowStatus` value,
attributed to RFC-007 D3. It is not: the actual `prisma/schema.prisma`
enum (above, corrected) never gained this value — the RFC decided it,
nothing ever migrated it in. The only place it survives in real code is
a stale comment in `packages/sails-sdk/src/modules/settlement.ts:48`.
Whoever picks up RFC-007 D3 for real needs a migration adding this enum
value plus the `PAYMENT_PENDING → PENDING_BANK_SETTLEMENT → COMPLETED`/
`DISPUTED` transition edges — not just a doc update.

```prisma

enum PaymentMethod {
  PIX
  TED
  BANK_TRANSFER
  CRYPTO_DIRECT
  LIGHTNING_DIRECT
  CASH
  OTHER
}
```

Note: `TradeStatus` and `EscrowStatus` are intentionally separate enums —
Trade is a coarser-grained lifecycle owned by OpenP2P, Escrow is the more
granular state machine owned by OpenSettlement. See
`PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` for how the 9-state canonical Trade Lifecycle
maps onto these two enums plus the Intent Engine's own lifecycle states.

## 3. Models

### `User` — owned by `openidentity`

```prisma
model User {
  id              String   @id @default(uuid())
  publicKey       String   @unique              // Ed25519, the sovereign identity
  displayName     String?
  peerId          String?  @unique              // HyperDHT peer id, set once P2P node starts
  reputationScore Float    @default(0)
  totalTrades     Int      @default(0)
  disputeCount    Int      @default(0)
  totalVolumeBtc  Decimal  @default(0) @db.Decimal(24, 8)  // RFC-009 — was Float
  verified        Boolean  @default(false)
  moduleId        String   @default("openidentity")
  protocolVersion String   @default("0.1")
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt

  offers             Offer[]
  buyerTrades        Trade[]           @relation("BuyerTrades")
  sellerTrades       Trade[]           @relation("SellerTrades")
  sentMessages       Message[]
  reputationGiven    ReputationEvent[] @relation("RaterEvents")
  reputationReceived ReputationEvent[] @relation("RatedEvents")

  @@map("users")
}
```

**Important:** `reputationScore`, `totalTrades`, `disputeCount`, and
`totalVolumeBtc` are written by the OpenReputation module's event handlers
(reacting to `settlement.escrow.released` and `openp2p.trade.disputed`), not
by OpenSettlement or OpenP2P directly. See `handlers.ts` in
`ARCHITECTURE.md` section 5 for the exact reactive flow. This was a real
coupling bug found and fixed during code review — do not reintroduce direct
writes to these fields from other modules.

### `Offer` — owned by `openliquidity` (NOT `openp2p` — this is deliberate)

**Corrected 2026-08-02** (the same `docs/BACKLOG.md` gap-consolidation
item that also flagged `FeeDistribution` missing entirely, closed below,
and `ArbiterProfile`/`PaymentAccount`, closed further down this file):
`feeCharged` above was missing from this listing since Phase 0 shipped —
now matches `prisma/schema.prisma` exactly.

### `FeeDistribution` — owned by `opensettlement`, RFC-021 Phase 0's real Protocol Fee split

```prisma
model FeeDistribution {

  @@map("fee_distributions")
}
```

One row per fee-charging release, created by `escrow.service.ts`'s
`chargeProtocolFee()` (`releaseFunds()` only — refunds never charge a
fee) whenever `config.settlement.protocolFeeRate` is non-zero. The
40/30/20/10 split is `PROTOCOL_ECONOMY.md` §6.2's already-decided
economics, not re-derived here — this table just persists the real
computed shares. Same "computed and persisted, not actually routed
on-chain" realness as `DisputeAppealFee` below: no `SettlementProvider`
in this codebase has a real configured treasury/node-operator/
wallet-rebate/arbitrator-reserve address to send any share to yet.
`Escrow.feeCharged` (above) is the same `totalFee` value, denormalized
onto the escrow itself so `User.cumulativeFeesObserved`/
`ArbiterProfile.cumulativeFeesObserved` (RFC-021 D4) can read it without
a join.

**Escrow state machine — valid transitions (enforced in application code,
not the database):**

```
CREATED                  → FUNDS_LOCKED, REFUNDED
FUNDS_LOCKED             → PAYMENT_PENDING, DISPUTED, REFUNDED
PAYMENT_PENDING          → COMPLETED, DISPUTED
COMPLETED                → (terminal)
DISPUTED                 → COMPLETED, REFUNDED
REFUNDED                 → (terminal)
```

*(`PAYMENT_PENDING → PENDING_BANK_SETTLEMENT → COMPLETED`/`DISPUTED` is
RFC-007 D3's designed-but-not-migrated extra state — see the note above
`EscrowStatus`'s definition. Once that migration lands, this table gains
the two edges back.)*

### `EscrowEvent` — audit log, owned by `opensettlement`

```prisma
model EscrowEvent {
  id          String       @id @default(uuid())
  escrowId    String
  escrow      Escrow       @relation(fields: [escrowId], references: [id])
  fromStatus  EscrowStatus
  toStatus    EscrowStatus

  note        String?
  createdAt   DateTime     @default(now())
  entryHash   String?      // RFC-008 D2 — sha256(fields + prevHash), null on pre-RFC-008 rows
  prevHash    String?      // RFC-008 D2 — prior EscrowEvent.entryHash for this tradeId/intentId; 'genesis' for the first chained entry

  @@map("escrow_events")
}
```

Every escrow state transition writes a row here — this is the append-only
audit trail used for dispute resolution (see `SECURITY_MODEL.md`).
`entryHash`/`prevHash` (RFC-008 D2, `rfcs/RFC-008-verifiable-timestamps-and-chained-timeline.md`)
are computed once, at write time, by the same code path that writes this
row — never recomputed at read time, or they prove nothing. Nullable so
existing rows are unaffected; `Timeline.verifyChain()` treats a `null`
`entryHash` as a chain-start boundary, not a break, so the tamper-evidence
guarantee only covers entries written after this RFC ships.

### `EscrowReleaseApproval` — owned by `opensettlement` (RFC-015)

```prisma
model EscrowReleaseApproval {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  escrowId   String
  approverId String   // must equal Trade.buyerId or Trade.sellerId
  approvedAt DateTime @default(now())

  @@unique([escrowId, approverId])
  @@map("escrow_release_approvals")
}
```

RFC-015's two-person control — application-layer, not on-chain multisig
(`@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm-erc-4337` is single-owner-only, checked
against its real compiled types before choosing this design; the
underlying blockchain transaction is still signed by one key regardless
of how many approvals this table has). Only meaningful when
`REQUIRE_DUAL_APPROVAL_RELEASE=true` (default `false`) — `escrow.service.ts`'s
`releaseFunds()` refuses to proceed on a normal (`PAYMENT_PENDING`)
release until both `Trade.buyerId` and `Trade.sellerId` have a row here
for that `escrowId`. Arbitrated releases (`Escrow.status === 'DISPUTED'`)
always bypass this table entirely, regardless of the flag — see that
RFC's Decision §3 for why re-requiring the two counterparties' agreement
after a dispute has already been raised would defeat arbitration's
purpose.

### `EscrowPendingTransaction` — owned by `opensettlement` (Phase 2 client-signature collection, documented here 2026-08-02)

```prisma

```

`MULTISIG`/`LIGHTNING_HODL`/`SAFE_GUARD_EVM` never hold a private key
that alone can sign a release/refund/split — buyer and seller keys are
client-held (`multisig.provider.ts`'s own header comment). This is the
async signature-collection round those three types need instead of a
single synchronous `SettlementProvider.releaseFunds()` call:
`escrow.service.ts`'s `initiateRelease()`/`initiateRefund()`/
`initiateSplit()` build and persist an unsigned PSBT here (`kind` says
which); each id in `requiredSigners` calls
`POST /v1/settlement/escrow/:id/submit-transaction-signature` with
their own independently-signed copy, upserted into
`EscrowTransactionSignature`; once every required signer has submitted,
`submitTransactionSignature()` combines them and finalizes for real
(`provider.finalizeRelease()`/`finalizeRefund()`/`finalizeSplit()`),
then deletes this row (`onDelete: Cascade` clears its signatures too) —
a completed round leaves no pending row behind, only `Escrow.txReleaseId`
as the durable record. On a `DISPUTED` release/refund, `requiredSigners`
has only one entry (the arbiter's own signature is pre-embedded in
`unsignedPsbtBase64` at build time, since the arbiter's key is still
server-derived); a `DISPUTED` split (RFC-021 D9) is the same shape, one
entry, for a real cryptographic reason, not a stylistic mirror — see
that RFC's own D9 section for why a 2-of-3 script can't take a third
independent signature on top of the arbiter's.

### `Dispute` — owned by `opensettlement`, first implementation of §1.9's primitive

The Dispute *primitive* (`PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` §1.9) predates this
table — this is its first persistence, added by the dispute-flow work
(`modules/open-settlement/dispute.service.ts`: `raiseDispute()` freezes
the escrow via the existing `escrowService.openDispute()` transition,
assigns an arbiter via `ArbitrationProvider` (RFC-007 D4's first real
implementation, `arbitration-provider.ts`), and notifies via
`dispute.opened` on the Event Bus; `resolveDispute()` maps
`RELEASE`/`REFUND` onto the existing escrow release/refund paths).

**Corrected 2026-08-02** (closing a gap first found 2026-08-01, widened
the same day RFC-021 D8 landed, both times left "not fixed here" until
now): the model above now matches `prisma/schema.prisma` exactly,
including D6's appeal fields and D8's auto-resolution fields.

One row per self-registered arbiter candidate (`MarketArbitrationProvider.register()`,
only meaningful under `ARBITRATION_MODE=market` — the default
`'trusted-list'` mode never creates or reads this table at all).
`effectiveStake = monetaryCollateral + arbiterReputation × REPUTATION_STAKE_FACTOR`
(RFC-021 D3, computed on read, not stored) determines eligibility for a
given dispute's value; `slash()` (D6, an overturned appeal) forfeits
`SLASH_COLLATERAL_FRACTION` of `monetaryCollateral` and applies
`OVERTURNED_PENALTY` to `arbiterReputation` — a separate field from
`User.reputationScore`, since an arbiter's professional track record and
a trader's own reputation are different things about the same person.
`slashedAt` is set on the first slash and never cleared — a slashed
arbiter's history stays visible, it isn't a one-time penalty that resets.

### `PaymentAccount` — owned by `opensettlement`, RFC-021 D5's real payment-account trust ramp

```prisma

  @@index([ownerId])
  @@map("payment_accounts")
}
```

Modeled directly on Bisq's real "Payment account age witness"/account
signing — a SEPARATE risk dimension from `User.reputationScore`: this
measures whether a specific payment rail (a PIX key, a bank account) has
survived a completed trade without a chargeback, which trader reputation
alone doesn't cover (an otherwise reputable trader's account can still be
stolen/compromised — the "conta laranja"/mule-account risk). `accountHash`
is the privacy-preserving hash both `payment-account.service.ts` (server)
and `@sails/sdk`'s `hashPaymentAccount()` (client) compute
byte-identically — the raw account identifier is never stored anywhere.
`getTradeLimit()`'s real ramp reads directly off this row:
`!signed` → `UNSIGNED_TRADE_LIMIT` (the floor, including a brand-new
account with no history at all) → `SIGNED_TRADE_LIMIT` once `signed` →
`ESTABLISHED_TRADE_LIMIT` at `ESTABLISHED_TRADE_COUNT` completed trades →
`'unlimited'` at `TRUSTED_TRADE_COUNT` completed trades with zero
`chargebacks` — a single real chargeback permanently caps the account at
`SIGNED_TRADE_LIMIT` regardless of `completedTrades`, by design (D5's own
stated rule: one reversal is a real, disqualifying signal, not averaged
away by later good trades). RFC-021 D7 (2026-08-02) added a second way
`signed` can become `true` at creation time: `getOrCreate()` pre-signs a
genuinely-new owner's first account when an active `Vouch` exists for
them (see `Vouch`'s own section below).

### `PayoutAddress` — owned by `opensettlement`, closed 2026-08-04 (BACKLOG.md's "Participant payout address" gap)

```prisma
model PayoutAddress {
  id            String    @id @default(uuid())
  participantId String
  participant   User      @relation(fields: [participantId], references: [id])

  @@unique([participantId, asset])
  @@map("payout_addresses")
}
```

A real, recurring gap surfaced by the dispute work: `resolveDispute()`'s
RELEASE/SPLIT rulings and `escrow.service.ts`'s `releaseFunds()`/
`splitFunds()`/`initiateRelease()`/`initiateSplit()` all needed a real
crypto address to pay a participant out to, and this schema modeled none
for any asset — callers had to pass one explicitly every single time.
Separate from `PaymentAccount` above (that's the FIAT rail a trader
*receives PIX/bank transfers on*, with a trust ramp and chargeback
tracking; this is the crypto address a trader *receives released escrow
funds at* — different asset class, no trust ramp needed, a wrong address
just fails to receive funds rather than enabling a chargeback) and
one row per (participant, asset) — `@@unique` enforces this — since a
BTC address and an EVM address for the same participant are unrelated
values, never one field covering both.

`payout-address.service.ts`'s `setPayoutAddress()`/`getPayoutAddress()`
are the read/write surface (`POST`/`GET /v1/settlement/payout-addresses`).
`escrow.service.ts`'s private `resolvePayoutAddress()` is the actual
fallback consumer: an explicit address passed to any of the four methods
above always wins; absent that, it looks up the participant's own
registered row for the escrow's asset; absent both, it throws a specific
error naming exactly what's missing (`CODE_STYLE.md` §2) rather than
guessing one.

### `DisputeAppealFee` — owned by `opensettlement`, RFC-021 D6's real appeal-fee charge (closed 2026-08-01)

```prisma
model DisputeAppealFee {
  id          String    @id @default(uuid())
  disputeId   String
  dispute     Dispute   @relation(fields: [disputeId], references: [id])
  appealRound Int       // which appeal round this charge is for — a Dispute can be appealed more than once
  requestedBy String    // the appellant (participantId) — dispute.service.ts's appeal() caller

  protocolVersion String @default("0.1")
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())

  @@unique([disputeId, appealRound])
  @@map("dispute_appeal_fees")
}
```

Same "computed and persisted, not actually routed on-chain" realness the
Protocol Fee itself already has (`FeeDistribution` below/`escrow.service.ts`'s
`chargeProtocolFee()`) — no `SettlementProvider` in this codebase has a
real configured treasury/arbitrator-reserve address to send anything to.
`appeal()` creates one row per round; `resolveDispute()` sets `outcome`
once the appeal panel rules (`FORFEITED` on a denied/frivolous appeal,
`REFUNDED` on an overturn). `outcome` is a plain `String`, not a new
Prisma enum, for a 2-value field this narrow — the same "free-form
string, enforced in code" choice `Claim.claimType`/`Message.msgType`
already make elsewhere in this schema.

### `Vouch` — owned by `openreputation`, RFC-021 D7's real peer-vouching bootstrap (2026-08-02)

```prisma
model Vouch {
  id          String    @id @default(uuid())
  voucherId   String
  voucher     User      @relation("VouchesGiven", fields: [voucherId], references: [id])
  voucheeId   String
  vouchee     User      @relation("VouchesReceived", fields: [voucheeId], references: [id])

  protocolVersion String @default("0.1")

  @@unique([voucherId, voucheeId])
  @@index([voucheeId])
  @@map("vouches")
}
```

Not a KYC/identity-linking primitive — corrected directly by the project
owner after an earlier RFC-021 draft used that framing (RFC-021's own D7
section has the full correction). A real protocol-native attestation:
`vouch.service.ts`'s `vouchFor()` requires the voucher to have real trade
history (`MIN_VOUCHER_TRADES = 3`) and positive `reputationScore` before
the vouch is even created; `@@unique([voucherId, voucheeId])` is the
actual one-vouch-per-pair-ever enforcement, not just application logic.
`payment-account.service.ts`'s `getOrCreate()` checks for an active
(`burnedAt: null`) vouch on a genuinely new owner's first `PaymentAccount`
and pre-signs it if one exists. `burnedAt` is set by
`burnVouchesFor()` (called from `common/events/handlers.ts`'s
`settlement.escrow.released`/`refunded` reactions) when the vouchee's
first lost dispute happens while the vouch is still active — the
voucher's own `User.reputationScore` takes a real penalty via
`reputation.service.ts`'s `penalizeForBurnedVouch()` at the same moment.

### `Intent`, `IntentEvent` — Core, first implementation (03-implementation_plan.md MVP)

```prisma
model Intent {
  id             String    @id @default(uuid())
  type           String

  events IntentEvent[]

  @@index([participantId])

  fromStatus  String?

  @@map("intent_events")
}
```

Real implementation, unlike `EscrowEvent`'s `entryHash`/`prevHash` above
(documented per RFC-008 D2 but still 🔲 in `BACKLOG.md`) —
`core/intent-engine.ts`'s `transition()` actually computes and writes them
on every `IntentEvent` row, `sha256(fromStatus|toStatus|triggeredBy|prevHash)`,
`'genesis'` for an Intent's first event. `payload` is intentionally opaque
`Json` — a new `IntentType` (e.g. `LoanIntent`) needs zero migration here,
only application-level TypeScript/Zod validation for its shape.
Deliberately 2 tables, not the 3 `PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` §2.6
originally sketched — see that section for why the `intent_payloads` split
turned out to add a join without adding any real flexibility once this
became a real Prisma model instead of a paper design.

### `Message` — owned by `openp2p` (Negotiation primitive / Secretstream chat)

```prisma
model Message {
  id        String    @id @default(uuid())
  tradeId   String
  trade     Trade     @relation(fields: [tradeId], references: [id])
  senderId  String
  sender    User      @relation(fields: [senderId], references: [id])
  content   String
  msgType   String    @default("TEXT")   // TEXT | IMAGE | PAYMENT_PROOF | SYSTEM
  readAt    DateTime?
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())

  @@index([tradeId])
  @@map("messages")
}
```

This table exists precisely because the messaging/negotiation module is
still necessary — see `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for why. `msgType =
PAYMENT_PROOF` is how the buyer proves to the seller that fiat was sent,
without the protocol ever touching the fiat itself.

### `ReputationEvent` — owned by `openreputation`

```prisma
model ReputationEvent {
  id              String   @id @default(uuid())
  tradeId         String
  trade           Trade    @relation(fields: [tradeId], references: [id])
  raterId         String
  rater           User     @relation("RaterEvents", fields: [raterId], references: [id])
  ratedId         String
  rated           User     @relation("RatedEvents", fields: [ratedId], references: [id])
  score           Int
  comment         String?
  moduleId        String   @default("openreputation")
  protocolVersion String   @default("0.1")
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  entryHash       String?  // RFC-008 D2 — same chaining rule as EscrowEvent above
  prevHash        String?  // RFC-008 D2

  @@unique([tradeId, raterId])
  @@map("reputation_events")
}
```

`@@unique([tradeId, raterId])` is a deliberate anti-abuse constraint — one
participant can only rate a given trade once.

**RFC-007 D8 note:** `ReputationEvent` rows remain the persisted record of
`rate()` calls, but as of RFC-007 they are informational feedback only —
no aggregate reputation-score computation reads `ReputationEvent.score`
directly. `ReputationScore` is computed exclusively from `SettlementOutcome`
events (via the `EscrowEvent` trail above and an internal `OutcomeEngine`,
not a new table — it's a computation over existing rows, not new state).
A `CancelledByAgreement` trade outcome always classifies `NEUTRAL` and can
never reduce the counterparty's score.

### `Claim`, `Proof`, `Verification` — owned by no single module (RFC-003)

**Corrected 2026-08-04 to match the real schema** — this section
previously described `EvidenceVerification` as the model name (to "avoid
a reserved-word collision"); the real, shipped model is named
`Verification`, no collision issue ever materialized. `Proof.evidence`
also gained a real `evidenceHash` — this whole shape has been real code
(`proof.service.ts`) since Fase 1, this doc simply hadn't been reconciled
with it until the RFC-007/008 pass below.

```prisma

### `EvidenceReference` — owned by `openproof` (RFC-007 D2, RFC-008 D1)

**Corrected 2026-08-04 to match the real, shipped implementation** — this
section previously described a design (`ProofFingerprint` as a separate
table, `anchorType`/`anchorData`/`anchoredAt` as three separate columns,
`EvidenceVerification` as the model name) written before any of RFC-007
D1/D2/D6 or RFC-008 D1 existed in code. Real deviations, each disclosed
in the relevant source file's own header comment:

```prisma
model EvidenceReference {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  proofId     String
  proof       Proof    @relation(fields: [proofId], references: [id])
  provider    String   // 'local-fs' | 's3' | 'r2' | 'ipfs' | 'arweave' | 'nostr.build' | ...
  uri         String
  sha256      String   // real hash of the stored media bytes — recomputed server-side
  mimeType    String   // 'image' | 'video' | 'document' | 'ocr' | 'external_reference'
  signature   String   // Ed25519, verified server-side against the submitter's own User.publicKey
  anchorProof Json?    // RFC-008 D1 — { anchorType, anchorId, submittedAt, upgraded }; null until anchored
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())

  @@map("evidence_references")
}
```

**No `ProofFingerprint` table.** `Proof.evidenceHash` (already real,
persisted by `submitProof()` since Fase 1, now `@@index`ed) already *is*
the fingerprint `ProofRegistry.findDuplicates()` (RFC-007 D1) queries by
— a separate table would duplicate data that already exists for a
different reason (`proof-registry.ts`'s own header comment has the full
reasoning). `findDuplicates()` scopes "a different intentId" as "a
different `Claim.tradeId`" — the model still doesn't have a real
`intentId` column, same situation `Timeline` below was already in.

**`anchorProof` is one `Json?` field, not three columns** — `AnchorProof`
(`timestamp-anchor.ts`) is a small, self-contained shape
(`{anchorType, anchorId, submittedAt, upgraded}`); a JSON column avoids
three mostly-null columns for a feature that, per RFC-008 D1's own
Policy-gating, most `EvidenceReference` rows will never use.

The protocol never stores the media itself — `EvidenceReference` is a
signed pointer into whichever `EvidenceProvider` the submitting Reference
Implementation configured (`LocalFilesystemEvidenceProvider` by default —
real, content-addressed, zero external credentials; a real S3/R2/IPFS
provider is a separate, still-unbuilt implementation of the same
interface).

**`EvidenceBundle` (RFC-007 D6) is not a table.** It is a query —
`ProofService.getEvidenceBundleForTrade(tradeId)`, real as of 2026-08-04
— that joins `Claim`, `Proof`, `Verification`, `EvidenceReference`, and
the Timeline projection (below) by `tradeId`, not this section's
originally-planned `intentId` (`Claim` gained a real, nullable `tradeId`
column for this) — the same real-world correction Timeline itself
already needed, consistent with RFC-007 rejecting `EvidenceBundle` as a
primitive with its own persisted lifecycle. Kept separate from the
already-shipped, per-Claim `getEvidenceBundle(claimId)` (its own real
SDK/React-hook surface) rather than renaming that method.

### `Timeline` — not a table (RFC-007 D5, corrected by RFC-017)

**Corrected 2026-07-19** (a consolidation-audit catch): RFC-007 D5
originally keyed this by `intentId`. RFC-017
(`rfcs/RFC-017-timeline-and-social-engineering-agent.md`) found that the
real events a Timeline consumer actually needs (chat, escrow,
negotiation) carry `tradeId` as their `correlationId` (RFC-010) today,
not `intentId` — no Intent-to-Trade persistence link exists yet to make
`intentId` the right key. `core/timeline.ts`'s real, shipped
`getTimeline(correlationId)` reflects RFC-017's correction; this section
previously still described RFC-007's original, superseded shape.

`Timeline.getEvents(correlationId)` is a read projection over events
already persisted by each module's own audit trail (e.g. `EscrowEvent`
above, `ReputationEvent`, future `DisputeEvent`), ordered by `createdAt`
and filtered to one `correlationId` (`tradeId` today; `intentId` once
Intent persistence exists — RFC-010's own convention). No new table —
adding one would duplicate state that already exists per-module, which
is exactly the outcome RFC-007's primitive-rejection reasoning was
written to avoid.
**RFC-008 D2** adds `entryHash`/`prevHash` columns directly to those same
per-module tables (see `EscrowEvent`/`ReputationEvent` above) rather than
a separate chain-ledger table — still no new table, but a real (nullable,
backward-compatible) schema change RFC-007's original "no new write path"
framing didn't anticipate.

### `OperationalProfileGrant` — owned by `openidentity` (RFC-007 D8/D11)

```prisma
model OperationalProfileGrant {
  id              String    @id @default(uuid())
  participantId   String    // a User.id — see RFC-001
  profile         String    // 'regular_trader' | 'liquidity_provider' | 'merchant' | 'arbitrator' | 'agent'
  grantedBy       String    // an application identifier, via Policy Engine — not protocol-level KYC
  criteria        Json?     // e.g. { minScore: 95, minTrades: 1000, noRecentDisputes: true }
  createdAt       DateTime  @default(now())
  revokedAt       DateTime?

  @@map("operational_profile_grants")
}
```

Mirrors `CapabilityGrant` below in shape and intent — `OperationalProfile`
is a scope a `CapabilityGrant` can reference (RFC-005), not a separate
permission mechanism. A `liquidity_provider` profile unlocks
Policy-Engine-gated behavior (e.g. `trustedSettlementAcceleration` on
`PENDING_BANK_SETTLEMENT`, section above) — never a fixed protocol
privilege.

### `Capability`, `CapabilityGrant` — Core components, not module-owned (RFC-005)

**Corrected 2026-07-19** (a consolidation-audit catch): this section
previously showed `Capability` as a persisted Prisma model alongside
`CapabilityGrant`. It was never that — RFC-013
(`rfcs/RFC-013-capability-registry-and-wallet-adapter.md`) explicitly
considered and rejected a `Capability`/`CapabilityImplementation` table
("a table with zero real write path") in favor of a static in-code map
(`capability-registry.ts`'s `CAPABILITY_IMPLEMENTATIONS`). `Capability`
is the abstract TypeScript interface (`PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md`
§1.10) any module implements — never a database row. Only
`CapabilityGrant`, the actual permission record, is persisted:

```prisma
model CapabilityGrant {
  id             String    @id @default(uuid())
  grantedTo      String    // a participantId or an Agent identifier
  capabilityName String    // references the in-code Capability map, not a foreign key
  scope          String[]
  constraints    Json?
  issuedBy       String
  createdAt      DateTime  @default(now())
  revokedAt      DateTime?

  @@map("capability_grants")
}
```

### A note on `Participant` (RFC-001) and this schema

`User` (above) remains the concrete table — it already has the right
shape (`publicKey`, `verificationLevel` via a level field, etc.) to satisfy
the `Participant` interface `Identity` implements. No new `Participant`
table is needed at the reference-implementation level; `Participant` is a
Core-level TypeScript abstraction (`PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` §1.1), not
a distinct persisted entity — `User.id` already serves as `participantId`
everywhere `Claim.claimedBy`, `CapabilityGrant.grantedTo`, etc. reference
one.



| Key pattern | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `trade:room:<tradeId>` | Last ~100 chat messages cached, TTL ~48h |
| `users:online` | Set of currently connected userIds (WebSocket) |
| `offers:<asset>:<side>` | Cached order book slice per asset/side |
| `reputation:<userId>` | Cached reputation score |
| `escrow:state:<escrowId>` | Cached current escrow state |
| `sails:events:<eventName>` | RFC-010's `RedisStreamsEventStore` (closed 2026-08-04) — Redis Stream, one per event name, real data (not cache): `XADD`ed at publish, consumer-group `XREADGROUP`/`XACK`'d at subscribe. Not currently the active store (`InMemoryEventStore` still is; see `BACKLOG.md`'s own precondition before switching) |
| `sails:events:by-correlation:<correlationId>` | Same store's second index — one Stream per correlationId, what `Timeline`/`getEvents()` would actually query once this store is active. A real design decision RFC-010 had left undecided (its own plan only named the per-eventName stream above) |

None of this is mandated by the protocol — a different reference
implementation could use any cache strategy or none at all.

## 5. Not Yet Implemented (Intent Engine's own tables)

`PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` describes a generic `intents` /
`intent_payloads` / `intent_transitions` table design for the future Intent
Engine core. **These tables do not exist yet** in `schema.prisma`. Today,
`Offer` with its `intentType` field is a stand-in for `TradeIntent`. Building
the full generic Intent Engine tables is a `Meses 1-3` / `Meses 4-6` roadmap
item — see `ROADMAP.md` and `TODO.md`.
