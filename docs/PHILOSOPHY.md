## Why Coordination, Not Custody

Every financial intermediary that has ever failed catastrophically —
banks, exchanges, custodians — failed at the same point: someone else held
the asset, and that someone else made a mistake, got hacked, or acted in
bad faith. Sails Protocol's founding belief is that **the failure mode
disappears entirely if no one but the owner ever holds the asset.** This
is not a risk-mitigation feature bolted onto a coordination protocol — it
is the reason a coordination protocol, instead of another custodial
platform, was worth building at all. Every technical decision in
`SECURITY_MODEL.md` and `THREAT_MODEL.md` traces back to this one belief.

## Why Intent, Not Instruction

An instruction ("send 0.005 BTC to address X") assumes the sender already
knows the exact, optimal way to achieve their goal. An Intent ("acquire
BTC exposure, under R$2,000, fastest available method") assumes they don't
have to. This distinction is not primarily about user experience — it's
about who is capable of using the protocol at all. A human typing an exact
instruction and a QVAC agent reasoning about the best execution path are
doing fundamentally different things if the protocol only accepts
instructions. They are doing the *same* thing — expressing an Intent — if
the protocol is built the way `PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` section 2
specifies. This is why `LONG_TERM_VISION.md`'s AI-agent future was
possible to describe credibly at all: the protocol didn't need a separate
"AI mode," because Intent already didn't care who or what expressed it.

## Why Modules, Not Features

A feature is something a product team decides to add. A module
(`ARCHITECTURE.md` section 3) is a capability that exists because it
implements primitives already present in the protocol — Discovery,
Negotiation, Settlement — applied to a new domain. This distinction is why
Sails OpenFinance does not need to reinvent escrow, reputation, or
discovery (`PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` section 1.12's summary table proves
this structurally, not just narratively): a module is not a feature
request, it is a new *lens* on primitives that already work. The
Coordination Engine (`ARCHITECTURE.md` section 1B) exists specifically so
that adding this new lens never requires touching the ones that came
before it.

## Why the Core Stays Small on Purpose

`LONG_TERM_VISION.md` opens with the claim that "the core is dumber than
the applications built on it," citing TCP/IP and Bitcoin's base layer. The
belief underneath that claim: **a protocol's lifespan is inversely related
to how much it tries to anticipate.** TCP/IP's designers did not design
HTTP. Satoshi's UTXO model did not anticipate Lightning. Neither protocol
needed to, because neither committed to knowing what applications would
need in advance — they committed to a minimal, stable contract (packets;
unspent outputs) that later applications could build on without
permission or a core rewrite. `PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` sections 1.10
and 1.11 exist because this belief was tested directly against real
proposals (Capability, Policy, Participant, Offer, Event) during
architectural review, and three of five were rejected — not because they
were bad ideas, but because accepting them would have made the core know
more than it needs to.

## Why Fiat Never Touches the Protocol

This is not a regulatory workaround — it is downstream of "why
coordination, not custody" above. A protocol that touches fiat is a
protocol that has taken on money-transmission risk, banking-license
requirements, and a custodial relationship with regulated currency, all of
which reintroduce exactly the single point of failure the protocol exists
to remove. `PRINCIPLES.md` principle 4 ("Fiat Off-Protocol") is the rule;
this is the reasoning that makes the rule non-negotiable rather than a
convenient default that could be relaxed under commercial pressure.

## Why Reputation Is Portable

A reputation score that only exists inside one application is not really a
signal of trustworthiness — it's a signal of how long someone has used
that specific application. Sails Protocol's belief is that trust, once
earned honestly (through real settlement volume, real dispute-free
history), should follow the person, not the platform. This is why
`PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` treats Reputation as a primitive any module can
read and write, rather than a feature OpenP2P happens to have built. It is
also why `LONG_TERM_VISION.md` can credibly describe reputation-informed
lending as a future direction: the portability was designed in from the
start, not retrofitted once someone asked for it.

## Why This Document Exists At All

A rulebook without reasoning eventually gets followed mechanically, and
mechanical rule-following is exactly how good architectures decay — someone
technically satisfies `PRINCIPLES.md`'s letter while violating what it was
protecting. This document is the answer to "why," so that a future
contributor facing a genuinely novel situation this handoff never
anticipated can reason from belief, not just check a rule that doesn't
quite fit yet.
