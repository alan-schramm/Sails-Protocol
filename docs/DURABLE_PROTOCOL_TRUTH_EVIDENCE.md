### Durable Protocol Truth Mission — Evidence Record

> Follows this repository's own evidence-artifact convention. This is
> evidence, not a marketing document — `OUTPUT != EVIDENCE != PROPERTY
> != CLAIM`.

## 1. Mission Scope

Investigation-only. No Core/Kernel/Constitution/schema/settlement/SDK
change authority. Builds on, and does not reopen, F03's own residual
("Durable Protocol Truth / operator-independent fact availability") and
Recovery/Reconciliation Conformance (frozen, PR #61, `aec3a16`).

## 2. Baseline

## 4. Sources Inspected and a Real Sourcing Gap

Full text of F02, F03, and F04's conclusions recovered verbatim from
their GitHub Project cards ("FOUNDATIONS-02 Conformance Depth Gaps",
"Protocol Independence & Decentralization Program", "Engineering
Philosophy Program" respectively — none of the four Foundations
missions has a standalone `docs/` file). **F01 ("Fundamental Protocol
Object") could not be located anywhere** — not in any of the 30 current
Project cards, not in git history (`git log --oneline --all | grep -iE
"F01|FOUNDATIONS"` returns zero genuine hits — the three superficial
regex matches found are confirmed false positives: one matches the
English word "foundations" in an unrelated commit subject, two match
substrings of unrelated commit *hashes*), not in any repository file.
Reported as a real, disclosed sourcing gap, not a material contradiction
between authorities (nothing found contradicts anything else — F01
simply cannot be located to check). This does not block this mission:
none of F01's plausible territory ("Fundamental Protocol Object") is
load-bearing for the specific question this mission investigates, and
`docs/CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md`/`SEMANTIC_KERNEL.md` independently cover
Core object identity.

**One real, disclosed discrepancy found (not a normative contradiction —
a stale-bookkeeping vs. code-reality mismatch):** the Project card
"OpenProof — Registry, Evidence Provider & Timestamp Anchor" states
verbatim that RFC-008's `TimestampAnchor`/`AnchorProof` are "genuinely
not started." Direct inspection of `src/modules/open-proof/timestamp-anchor.ts`
and RFC-008's own text shows `anchor()` is real, working code —
"submission... verified against a live public OpenTimestamps calendar
server before writing this file," live-wired into `proof.service.ts`'s
`anchorEvidence()`. Reported as fact; not resolved here (no Project
write authority).

## 5. Refined Definition of "Protocol Truth"

CTO candidate, attacked: *"Protocol Truth is the minimum set of
protocol-relevant facts and bindings whose preservation and admissible
interpretation are necessary for independent parties to verify the
economic meaning of an interaction and, where protocol semantics permit,
continue, recover, exit, or audit it without privileged access to the
original operator."*

**Attack found one real ambiguity, corrected:** the candidate definition
conflates "necessary for verification" with "necessary for
continuation" as if they always require the same fact set. This
investigation's own findings (section 9) show they do not — some facts
are sufficient for historical verification but not for continuation
(e.g. an unanchored hash chain proves internal consistency, not
existence-since; a signed Authority decision proves what was decided,
not that DestinationBinding is bound to it). **Refined definition,
retained:**

*Protocol Truth is the minimum set of protocol-relevant facts and
bindings whose preservation and admissible interpretation — separately
for verification, and separately for continuation where protocol
semantics permit it — do not depend on privileged, continued access to
the original operator.*

This is not a cosmetic change: it forces every fact class (section 6)
to be scored against verification and continuation as distinct
questions (section 8's C column vs. V column), rather than one merged
"is it Protocol Truth, yes/no."

## 6. Fact != Truth != Evidence != Claim; Durable != Available != Portable != Verifiable

Preserved throughout this document (attacked, not assumed): a
PostgreSQL row can be durable (survives process restart) without being
operator-independent (only Satsails can read it). A signed object
(`AuthorityDecisionPayload`) can be portable (the SDK ships the exact
canonicalization) without being available (nothing forces it off the
operator's server before disappearance). A hash can commit to a fact
without the underlying data still existing to check against it (section
9's genesis finding). A verified historical fact (a signature checks
out) may still be insufficient to continue an interaction (section 11's
mid-interaction analysis).

## 7. Fact Taxonomy (T1-T12)

| Class | Definition | Repository status |
|---|---|---|
| T1 — Interaction Identity/Scope | `InteractionId`/`escrowId`/`disputeId`/`appealRound` | Opaque scope, durable in Postgres; portable via API responses (section 10) |
| T2 — Ruleset/Semantic Identity | `rulesetIdentity`/`evaluatorIdentity`/`profileIdentity` | Durable (`SemanticTransitionRecord` columns), portable — returned verbatim by `GET /v1/settlement/disputes/:id/semantic-record` |
| T3 — Assertions/Evidence | `EvidenceReference` (RFC-007/008), `EvidenceBundle` | Durable; `sha256` individually anchorable via real `TimestampAnchor.anchor()` (policy-gated, not universal) |
| T4 — Authority Facts | `AuthorityDecisionPayload` (`disputeId, escrowId, appealRound, authorityId, outcome, buyerBps, issuedAt`) + Ed25519 signature | **Cryptographically real** — signed, domain-separated, canonicalization shipped in both server and SDK, cross-checked by `tests/arbitrationAuthoritySdkParity.test.ts` |
| T5 — Outcome | `ArbitrationOutcomeContent` (ruling, allocations, remainderBeneficiary) | Durable (`SemanticTransitionRecord.outcomeContent Json?`), **but `hashOutcomeContent()` is never called anywhere in the codebase** — see section 9 |
| T6 — DestinationBinding | Resolved beneficiary destination(s) | Durable (`outcomeDestinationBinding Json?`), **never hashed or signed anywhere** — see section 9 |
| T7 — Execution Facts | Provider, rail, txid, attempt, amount, asset, destination reported | Durable (`Escrow`/`EscrowPendingTransaction` columns); MULTISIG's own txid is self-derived, not provider-trusted (Recovery evidence) |
| T8 — Correspondence Facts | `CorrespondenceEvaluation` (evaluator+policy identity, results) | Durable, append-only, fail-closed on disagreement (Recovery evidence §13); **no route/SDK surface found exposing it directly** |
| T9 — Recovery/Reconciliation Facts | Historical destination/allocation snapshot, pending-tx signatures | Durable, MULTISIG-scoped (Recovery evidence) |
| T10 — External Reality References | Chain state, confirmation depth, reorg state | Deliberately **not** made durable-as-current — only durable-as-historical-observation (section 12) |
| T11 — Historical Evolution | `EscrowEvent` chain, `DurableEventRecord`/Timeline chain | Both real, hash-chained, append-only — **both anchored at a hardcoded, non-externally-verified `'genesis'` sentinel** — see section 9 |
| T12 — Privacy/Disclosure Metadata | Party-only vs. public read scoping | Real and enforced (`INV-OP-10`, section 13) — not invented here |

## 8. Minimum Sufficient Truth — Challenge Per Class

Applying "if this fact disappears permanently, what becomes impossible"
to each T-class: T1-T2 loss → historical verification and future
reconstruction both fail (nothing to interpret). T3 loss → dispute
audit fails for that specific claim, not global. T4 loss → attribution
fails entirely — no other fact substitutes for a lost signature. T5/T6
loss → economic meaning becomes ambiguous even though (per section 9)
they are *already* only weakly protected. T7 loss → execution-fact
disputes become unresolvable, but T4/T5/T6 alone remain enough to state
what *should* have happened. T8 loss → correspondence verification
fails for that evaluation only (a new one can be recomputed from T5/T6/T7
if those survive). T9 loss → recovery for that specific crash window
fails; already scoped to MULTISIG. T10 is deliberately never retained
as current fact — no loss because none is claimed. T11 loss → tamper-
evidence for the transition *sequence* is lost, not the economic facts
themselves (which live in T5-T7, separately). T12 loss (i.e., scoping
removed) → privacy fails, not survivability.

**No fact class was found where the honest answer is "nothing
protocol-relevant" — every class earns its place. No class was added
purely for completeness.**

## 9. D/A/P/V/R/C Matrix

D=Durable, A=Available, P=Portable, V=Verifiable, R=Reconstructable,
C=Continuation-capable. No scores are averaged; a single missing
critical dimension is reported as decisive.

| Class | D | A | P | V | R | C |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T4 Authority Facts | Yes | Party-scoped (2 routes combined) | Yes — SDK ships canonicalization | **Yes**, independently, via Ed25519 math | Yes | Yes (feeds T9) |
| T5 Outcome content | Yes | Party-scoped | Yes (returned as plain fields) | **No** — `hashOutcomeContent()` exists, tested, never called; not bound to T4's signature | Partial — deterministically re-derivable from T4's signed `buyerBps` + the escrow's `totalUnits`/`asset`, IF those are trusted | Yes, informationally |
| T6 DestinationBinding | Yes | Party-scoped | Yes (returned as plain fields) | **No** — never hashed, never signed, exists only as a plain JSON column populated from a live `PayoutAddress` lookup at commit time | **No** — not derivable from any signed or durable fact; it is *the* one fact that is purely a database claim | No independent proof possible |
| T11 EscrowEvent chain | Yes | Internal only — **no route/SDK exposes it** | No | Internally self-consistent (`verifyEscrowEventChain()`), but genesis is a hardcoded, non-anchored `'genesis'` string | Partial — sequence yes, economic content no (chain excludes amounts/destination) | N/A |
| T11 DurableEventRecord chain | Yes | Yes — full `timeline` array returned by the proof-bundle route | Yes | Same as above, genesis unanchored; full payload IS committed (stronger than EscrowEvent's chain) | Yes for sequence+payload | N/A |
| T3 Evidence (`EvidenceReference.sha256`) | Yes | Depends on `EvidenceProvider` | Depends on provider | **Yes, when policy-gated `TimestampAnchor` used** — real external Bitcoin-anchored submission | Yes | N/A |
| T7 Execution facts (MULTISIG) | Yes | Party-scoped + public chain | Yes | Yes — self-derived txid, chain-observable | Yes | Yes (Recovery evidence) |

**The single most decisive finding in this matrix: T6 (DestinationBinding)
fails Verifiable and Reconstructable outright, for the one rail
(MULTISIG) that otherwise has the strongest chain of custody in the
whole system.** Section 15 develops this in full.

## 10. Actor Availability Analysis

- **Buyer/seller**: hold their own MULTISIG/LIGHTNING_HODL/SAFE_GUARD_EVM
  keys (client-submitted `EscrowParticipantKey`); can read T1/T2/T3/T4/T5/T6/T8
  (as returned) via party-scoped routes while Satsails operates; hold
  nothing durably outside Satsails' database once it disappears, absent
  their own copy — no export mechanism exists (section 14).
- **Arbiter**: signs T4 with an Ed25519 key registered as `User.publicKey`
  — a **plain, Satsails-controlled database column**, not something the
  arbiter independently publishes or anchors elsewhere.
- **Independent wallet / independent Sails implementation**: can verify
  T4 given the payload + signature + claimed public key (the math is
  real and portable), but cannot independently confirm that public key
  was genuinely the arbiter's key *at decision time*, absent an
  out-of-band channel Satsails does not provide.
- **Auditor/verifier, external observer**: no public (non-party) route
  exposes any of T1-T9 today — every read surface found is party-scoped
  (`isParty`) or narrower.
- **Recovery process**: already fully analyzed (Recovery evidence);
  unaffected by this mission.

## 11. Disappearance Worlds

| World | What breaks |
|---|---|
| A — App disappears, backend remains | Nothing new — same as ordinary downtime |
| B — Backend disappears, participants keep wallets/local artifacts | Any fact never proactively exported (all of them — section 14) becomes unavailable; local wallet key material alone proves nothing about *why* a settlement was authorized |
| C — Database disappears, external rails remain | T7 (on-chain facts) reconstructable from the chain itself; T4/T5/T6 (authority/outcome/destination) **gone** unless a party independently retained their own API response from while the system was live |
| D — Organization disappears, repo/participants remain | Semantic/ruleset identity (T2) and the algorithms (`allocateExactUnits`, canonicalization functions) are open-source and reconstructable without permission; the *specific historical facts* (T4-T6) are not, per world C |
| E — Maintainers disappear, repo frozen | A stranger can read the code/RFCs/conformance vectors and reconstruct *protocol meaning* (section 15); cannot reconstruct *what actually happened* in any specific historical interaction without a durable, exported copy |
| F — Reference implementation disappears | Specifications (Semantic Kernel, Core Architecture, conformance vectors) survive independently in `docs/`/`conformance/` — real, already demonstrated by the Condition Algebra mission's own non-circular-derivation discipline |
| G — One participant disappears | The counterparty and external rails retain T7; T4-T6 remain wherever they already were (party-scoped, so the *surviving* party can still read them) |
| H — Arbiter disappears after decision | T4 (signed decision) already survives independently of the arbiter's continued availability — this is exactly what the signature is for, and it works |
| I — Operator becomes hostile | See section 16 (Hostile Operator/Equivocation Test) — this is a stronger threat than mere disappearance and is analyzed separately |

## 12. Mid-Interaction Survival

Applying CONTINUE/RECOVER/EXIT/FAIL SAFELY/FAIL UNSAFELY/UNKNOWN per
stage, for MULTISIG (the only rail with any of this machinery):

| Stage | Outcome if operator disappears here |
|---|---|
| Before authority decision | FAIL SAFELY — nothing was ever authorized; no loss |
| After signed decision, before Outcome commit | UNKNOWN — the signature is portable (if the party captured it) but the durable commit never happened; whether this is recoverable depends entirely on whether the signed bytes survived off-server |
| After Outcome commit, before dispatch | RECOVER — this is exactly what Recovery Conformance's C4 demonstrates, **while the operator is present**; if the operator is the one that disappeared, RECOVER becomes UNKNOWN because the durable record it reads from is itself gone (world C) |
| After dispatch, before execution | Same as above |
| After execution, before observation | FAIL SAFELY toward the chain's own truth — T7 is independently observable on-chain regardless of Satsails |
| After correspondence | Already-computed T8 is lost if the operator disappears (not exported); recomputable by a party who independently retains T4/T5/T6/T7 |
| During reconciliation | Depends entirely on the operator being present — Recovery Conformance's own machinery is itself operator-hosted |
| After historical completion | EXIT is the honest label — nothing more is expected to happen; whether the *history* of what happened remains provable depends on section 9's D/A/P/V/R/C findings, not on this stage |

**Not every state is currently representable as its own distinct
recoverable case — this is reported honestly, not claimed solved.**

## 13. Stranger Reconstruction Test

Sharpened per the precision pass into two explicitly distinct
sub-verdicts — success on one must never hide failure on the other:

**Protocol reconstructability (`can a stranger understand the system
itself`): DEMONSTRATED.** A technically competent third party given
only what is actually documented/open-source (`docs/CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`SEMANTIC_KERNEL.md`, conformance vectors, the SDK code) can determine:
the semantic/ruleset identity model (T2) in the abstract; exactly how
canonicalization/hashing/signing work (T4, section 18.2); the
deterministic Outcome-allocation algorithm (T5, section 18.3). This is
real and already independently demonstrated by the Condition Algebra
mission's own non-circular-derivation discipline.

**Interaction reconstructability (`can a stranger prove what happened in
one specific interaction`): NOT DEMONSTRATED.** The same stranger
**cannot** determine, for any *specific* historical interaction, without
an exported copy of that interaction's own API responses: which
interaction it was, what evidence existed, what was actually decided,
what Outcome/destination followed, or whether execution corresponded —
because none of that is published anywhere outside Satsails' database,
and no export mechanism exists (section 14). This is a **missing
portability** failure, not a legitimate privacy boundary — nothing in
`INV-OP-10` requires this data to be undiscoverable by the *parties
themselves*; it simply isn't proactively made available to survive the
operator.

**Success on protocol reconstructability does not offset failure on
interaction reconstructability — both are reported as distinct rows in
section 22's property matrix.**

## 13b. T4 Authority Fact — Availability Correction (precision pass)

The prior pass's implicit equation `NO EXPORT ENDPOINT = NO EXTERNAL
COPY CAN EXIST` is corrected here — it does not hold for T4
specifically. Confirmed directly: `POST /v1/settlement/disputes/:id/resolve`
(`settlement.routes.ts`) declares `authoritySignature: z.string().min(1)`
as a **request-body field** — the signature is computed by the caller
*before* the request is sent, meaning **the server never holds, and
never needs to hold, the arbiter's private signing key.** The arbiter's
own device is therefore the artifact's natural point of origin,
independent of Satsails' infrastructure, before any server involvement
at all — not because an export feature exists, but because the
architecture never centralizes signing in the first place.

Buyer and seller can additionally retrieve the raw `signatureHex` +
`resolvedIdentityReference` via the party-scoped
`GET /v1/settlement/disputes/:id/semantic-record` route while the
operator is live (section 10). So, at minimum, three parties (arbiter,
buyer, seller) naturally have the opportunity to hold a copy of T4
independent of Satsails — the arbiter by construction, buyer/seller by
a real, already-existing read surface.

**What remains genuinely unproven:** whether any of these parties'
own clients *durably retain* that copy is outside this repository's
control — no evidence either way was found or claimed. Revised
classification:

```
T4 AUTHENTICITY:                        DEMONSTRATED
T4 DURABILITY (server-side):            DEMONSTRATED (Postgres, while operator present)
T4 PARTICIPANT AVAILABILITY:            DEMONSTRATED — natural client-side origin + party-scoped read access
T4 PORTABILITY:                         PARTIAL — the SDK ships the exact canonicalization; no dedicated export route exists, but the raw signed material is already reachable by 3 real parties
T4 OPERATOR-INDEPENDENT SURVIVABILITY:  PARTIAL, stronger than previously stated — depends on whether a party's own client retains what it already, naturally receives, not on any Satsails-provided mechanism
```

## 14. Portability Test

`READABLE != EXPORTABLE != PORTABLE != SELF-VERIFYING`, tested directly:

- T4 is **self-verifying** (Ed25519 math, portable canonicalization) —
  the strongest category.
- T2/T5/T6/T8 are **readable** (while the operator is live, party-scoped)
  but **not proactively exportable** — no export/backup/GDPR-style route
  exists anywhere in this repository (confirmed by exhaustive grep, zero
  hits, corroborating F03's own RESIDUAL 1 finding verbatim).
- T11 (Timeline/DurableEventRecord chain) is **readable and portable**
  via `GET /v1/proof/trades/:tradeId/bundle`, but the SDK's own
  `TradeEvidenceBundle` type omits fields (`timelineDurable`,
  `timelineStore`) the server actually returns — a real, minor
  server/SDK field-list drift, disclosed here.
- Nothing is **self-verifying** for T6, because nothing hashes or signs
  it (section 9).

## 15. Second Implementation Test

An independent implementation consuming only the intended durable
artifacts (SDK responses, RFC text, conformance vectors) could: verify
T4 signatures without asking Satsails anything ("Ask Satsails what this
field means" never applies to T4 — the canonicalization is fully
specified and cross-tested). It **could not** independently confirm
that a returned T5/T6 pair was ever actually authorized by the T4
signature it also received, because nothing links them cryptographically
— the second implementation would have to trust Satsails' own database
association, exactly the failure mode this mission exists to test for.

## 16. Recovery Intersection

Recovery Conformance's own claim (frozen, PR #61) is: *recovery
reconstructs execution from durable and admissible external facts
without re-authorizing selected economic meaning.* This mission's
finding does not weaken that claim — Recovery Conformance was evaluated
**while the operator is present** (its own real-Postgres evidence
requires a live database), and correctly never claimed otherwise. What
this mission adds: the durable facts Recovery depends on (T4, T5, T6 in
particular) are themselves operator-dependent per section 9 — so
Recovery Conformance's "durable" is `REAL POSTGRES DURABILITY`, which
this mission explicitly does **not** treat as equivalent to `OPERATOR-
INDEPENDENT PROTOCOL DURABILITY`. Recovery Conformance is not reopened,
not redesigned, and its own evidence stands unmodified.

## 17. Correspondence Intersection

T8 (`CorrespondenceEvaluation`) survival depends entirely on T5/T6/T7
surviving (it is a recomputation over them) plus its own row, which is
durable-but-operator-dependent, no different from T5/T6. No new gap is
introduced beyond what section 9 already states; not absorbed further,
not implemented.

## 18. Authority -> Outcome -> Destination Chain Analysis (precision pass)

**This is the mission's central, most load-bearing finding — reworked
below with a full binding-chain trace, a deterministic-derivation
challenge, and a precise (not inflated) reassociation classification,
per the CTO's own required precision pass.**

### 18.1 Central question, stated precisely

*Can an independent verifier establish, without trusting operator-held
database associations, that a specific Outcome and DestinationBinding
are the authorized consequence of a specific signed Authority decision?*

### 18.2 Full binding-chain trace

| Link | Mechanism(s) | Independent verification | Operator trust required? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Interaction -> Authority Actor | DATABASE-ASSOCIATED ONLY (`Dispute.arbiterId`/`escrowId`) | No dedicated check found | Yes, for the *assignment* fact itself |
| Authority Actor -> Signed Decision | SIGNED (Ed25519) + SEMANTICALLY CONSTRAINED (`AuthorityDecisionPayload` fields are exhaustive and domain-separated) | **Yes** — `verifyAuthorityDecisionSignature()`, reproducible client-side via the SDK's own `canonicalizeAuthorityDecision()`/`hashAuthorityDecision()` | No, for the signature itself. Yes, for confirming the signing key was genuinely the arbiter's *at decision time* (section 21) |
| Signed Decision -> Outcome content | **DETERMINISTICALLY DERIVABLE**, not merely unhashed — see 18.3 | Partial — derivable given the signed `ruling`/`buyerBps` PLUS independently-obtainable `totalUnits`/`asset` (chain-observable for MULTISIG) PLUS `buyerId`/`sellerId` (database-associated only) | Yes, for `buyerId`/`sellerId`; no, for the allocation math itself once those are known |
| Outcome -> DestinationBinding | **NOT BOUND** — see 18.4 | **No mechanism found** | Yes, entirely |
| DestinationBinding -> Execution Request | TRANSACTIONALLY ASSOCIATED (same-Postgres-transaction snapshot, M8-R) + SEMANTICALLY CONSTRAINED at dispatch (`dispatch-translation-guard.ts` compares the snapshot against the real PSBT) | Yes, but only *that the dispatch matches the snapshot* — never that the snapshot itself was correct | Yes, for the snapshot's own correctness |
| Execution Request -> External Execution | SELF-DERIVED (MULTISIG: `tx.getId()` computed before broadcast, never the provider's own reported value — Recovery evidence) | **Yes**, chain-observable | No |
| External Execution -> Correspondence | DETERMINISTICALLY DERIVED (`evaluateFinalizedTransactionCorrespondence()`, recomputes from real tx bytes) | Yes, recomputable by anyone with the real tx and the durable Outcome | Yes, for trusting the durable Outcome it compares against (same weak link as above) |

**The chain is independently verifiable through the Signed Decision, and
again from External Execution onward. It has exactly one break: Outcome
-> DestinationBinding.**

### 18.3 Deterministic Derivation Challenge — Outcome content

`buildRulingOutcomeContent(ruling, totalUnits, asset, buyerId, sellerId,
buyerBps)` (`dispute-outcome.ts`) is a **pure function**, open-source,
unit-tested. Of its six parameters: `ruling` and `buyerBps` are
literally part of the signed `AuthorityDecisionPayload`. `totalUnits`/
`asset` are the escrow's own locked amount/asset — for MULTISIG,
independently observable on-chain (the funding transaction), not
arbiter-decided. `buyerId`/`sellerId` are the trade's own participants —
currently database-associated only (no signature found binding trade
formation in this pass; out of this mission's scope to trace further).

**Conclusion: Outcome content is deterministically derivable from the
signed decision plus independently-obtainable context, given
`buyerId`/`sellerId`.** The absence of a call to `hashOutcomeContent()`
does **not**, by itself, mean Outcome content is unbound — it means the
binding mechanism that actually exists is deterministic derivation, not
hashing. `hashOutcomeContent()` exists and is tested but has no
production call site in the inspected baseline — this fact is reported
exactly that narrowly, not expanded into "Outcome is unprotected."

### 18.4 DestinationBinding full lifecycle — where the chain actually breaks

Traced end to end: **creation** — `resolveBeneficiaryDestination()`
reads `PayoutAddress`, a participant-registered, participant-mutable
row, inside the same transaction as the Outcome commit (M8-R). **No
input to this read is signed by the arbiter, derivable from anything
signed, or constrained by ruleset semantics** — unlike Outcome content,
there is no pure function that produces a unique valid destination from
public/durable facts; the destination is *chosen by the beneficiary at
registration time*, a genuinely free-standing fact. **Validation**:
none at write time beyond "a row exists." **Persistence**:
`outcomeDestinationBinding Json?`, written once, inside the
transaction. **Mutation**: `Grep` confirms **zero application-code
`.update()`/`.upsert()` calls against `semanticTransitionRecord`
anywhere in `src/`** — the row is insert-only by application
convention (matching `EscrowEvent`/`EvidenceReference`'s own append-only
discipline), though this is **enforced only in code, not by a database
trigger** — `tests/integration/dbNativeInvariants.test.ts` (the suite
that tests real DB-native triggers for other financial tables) has no
entry for `semantic_transition_records`. **Read**: via the party-scoped
semantic-record route, plain JSON, no re-verification against anything.
**Use by provider**: `dispatch-translation-guard.ts` compares the
snapshot's plain value against the real PSBT — confirmed zero
hash-related code in that file. **Use by correspondence/recovery**:
both consume the same unhashed snapshot as ground truth (Recovery
evidence).

**Precisely where independent verifiability stops:** not at "signed
decision," not at "Outcome content" (both survive, per 18.2/18.3). It
stops exactly at the moment `resolveBeneficiaryDestination()`'s result
is written — a fact that is genuinely un-derivable from anything signed
or ruleset-constrained, and therefore has no possible "hash it and
compare" fix without also solving a harder problem (the beneficiary's
own destination choice was never signed by anyone at registration time
either — `PayoutAddress` registration is not part of this mission's
traced scope).

### 18.5 Operator Reassociation Claim — corrected classification

**C — STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY / EQUIVOCATION RISK.** No dynamic
mutation/reload experiment was run (no A), and no exploit was
constructed to manufacture one — per the mission's own explicit
instruction, "Correct C > Artificial A." What was structurally traced
and confirmed: (1) the application itself has no code path that
UPDATEs an existing `SemanticTransitionRecord` row — reassociation of
an *already-committed* record via the app's own normal operation is
not something the running system does; (2) nothing at the database
level (`dbNativeInvariants.test.ts` has no corresponding trigger)
prevents a privileged party with direct database access from doing so
anyway; (3) more importantly, **the write-time integrity gap exists
regardless of any later mutation risk** — because nothing independently
constrains what gets written in the first place, an honest,
never-tampered-with row and a subtly-wrong one (application bug,
`PayoutAddress` changed mid-transaction by something outside this
code's control, or operator error) are **indistinguishable** to any
verifier, including a completely honest one, without trusting the
database's own claim.

**Corrected statement, replacing the prior mission's overreaching
"operator can rewrite association" claim:** *The current investigation
found no independently verifiable binding between the persisted
DestinationBinding and the signed Authority artifact, and confirmed the
application itself has no code path to mutate an already-committed
record. An independent verifier therefore cannot establish, for any
specific historical ruling, that the recorded destination is genuinely
what the signed decision implies — not because reassociation was
demonstrated, but because no mechanism exists to rule it out.*

### 18.6 Four-question test (Authority -> Outcome -> Destination)

- **Question A** (authenticate the Authority decision): **YES**,
  independently, via Ed25519 verification against the canonical digest.
- **Question B** (prove which Outcome is the unique authorized
  consequence): **YES, conditionally** — deterministically derivable
  given the signed fields plus `totalUnits`/`asset`/`buyerId`/`sellerId`
  (18.3); the condition is trusting those four inputs, not trusting an
  Outcome hash that doesn't exist.
- **Question C** (prove which DestinationBinding is the unique
  authorized consequence): **NO** — no mechanism, cryptographic or
  deterministic, exists (18.4).
- **Question D** (A+B+C without operator database/API trust, private
  code, or institutional knowledge): **NO — fails exactly at C.** A and
  B alone do not require operator trust (the canonicalization,
  verification, and allocation functions are all open-source and
  reproducible); C cannot be completed independently at all.

**First point where the chain ceases to be independently verifiable:
Outcome -> DestinationBinding, and only there.**

## 19. Mutant / Wrong-Truth Challenge

| Mutant | Repository verdict |
|---|---|
| M1 — Database Is Truth | **Rejected in principle** by this document's own definition (section 5); **partially true in practice** for T5/T6 today, since nothing else currently substitutes |
| M2 — Latest State Is Enough | **Rejected** — `INV-05`, append-only `EscrowEvent`/`EvidenceReference`/`DurableEventRecord`, real and enforced |
| M3 — Signed Decision Is Everything | **Rejected, correctly, by architecture** — but the converse gap (section 18) means the *opposite* failure mode exists: signed decision survives, but what it's bound to does not |
| M4 — Blockchain Is Everything | **Explicitly rejected** — RFC-008 itself rejected "anchor every EvidenceReference on a blockchain, always" for cost/latency (Infrastructure Neutral, Principle 6) |
| M5 — Public Everything | **Explicitly rejected** — RFC-008 rejected a single global Merkle root for privacy-structure-leakage reasons (Principle 8); `INV-OP-10` is a real, tested, repeatedly-enforced minimization discipline (three closed violations, section 4/17 of that invariant) |
| M6 — Operator Export Equals Portability | **Not applicable — no export exists at all** (section 14); this mutant cannot even be exercised yet, which is itself the finding |
| M7 — Hash Without Availability | **Present, inverted** — T11's chains have hashes with availability (T11 DurableEventRecord) or availability without export (T11 EscrowEvent); the more severe converse (M8) is what actually occurs for T6 |
| M8 — Availability Without Authenticity | **Confirmed present for T6** — DestinationBinding is available (readable, party-scoped) but has zero authenticity mechanism (section 9/18) |
| M9 — Authenticity Without Semantics | **Not found** — T4's signature is fully semantically scoped (ruling + buyerBps, nothing more, nothing less, by design) |
| M10 — Cached External Reality | **Explicitly rejected by architecture** — `OBSERVATION != FINALITY` already demonstrated (Recovery evidence); every sweep re-asks the real explorer |
| M11 — Reference Implementation Is Specification | **Rejected** — `docs/CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md`/`SEMANTIC_KERNEL.md`/conformance vectors are independently specified and already demonstrated non-circularly derivable (Condition Algebra mission) |
| M12 — Replication Equals Decentralization | **Not tested by this mission** — no replication of any kind exists today to evaluate; correctly not claimed |

## 20. Privacy Red Team

The naive proposition ("everything needed for survivability should be
globally replicated forever") is **already rejected by real,
demonstrated architecture**, not merely by this mission's own
disclaimer: `INV-OP-10` (three real violations found and closed —
payment-account, payout-address, identity-participant surfaces) and
RFC-008's own explicit rejection of global-Merkle/always-anchor
alternatives citing Principle 8. This mission adds no new privacy
mechanism and proposes none.

**Precision correction:** the demonstrated property is narrower than
"`Portable != Public` is demonstrated" — that phrasing risks implying
portability itself was shown to exist, which section 14/17 explicitly
find is not the case. The corrected, precise statement:

```
GLOBAL PUBLICATION:            NOT REQUIRED (by design — INV-OP-10, RFC-008)
PUBLIC-SURFACE MINIMIZATION:   DEMONSTRATED (three real, closed violations)
PARTICIPANT PORTABILITY:       NOT DEMONSTRATED (section 14/17)
```

*The architecture demonstrates that protocol-relevant information need
not be globally public. Participant portability itself is not currently
demonstrated.* `Portable != Public` is retained as a **design
principle** this codebase already honors on the public-minimization
half — not as a claim that the portable half exists today.

## 21. External Reality Limit

`DURABLE HISTORICAL FACT != CURRENT EXTERNAL REALITY` is already
correctly implemented (Recovery evidence, `multisig-release-reorg-sweep.ts`'s
own append-only World A-E classification) — not re-litigated here. This
mission's own T10 fact class explicitly excludes "current chain state"
from durable Protocol Truth, consistent with that finding.

## 22. Property-by-Property Verdicts (precision pass — required table)

| Property | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Protocol Semantic Reconstructability | **DEMONSTRATED** — section 13; a stranger can understand the system itself from open-source docs/code/vectors |
| Authority Authenticity | **DEMONSTRATED** — section 18.6 Question A; Ed25519, independently reproducible |
| Authority Operator-Independent Availability | **PARTIAL, corrected upward from the prior pass** — section 13b; client-side signing means a natural external copy exists at 3 real parties (arbiter, buyer, seller), not because of any export feature; durable retention by those parties' own clients is unproven either way |
| Outcome Operator-Independent Survivability | **PARTIAL** — section 18.3; deterministically derivable from signed fields + `totalUnits`/`asset` (chain-observable for MULTISIG) + `buyerId`/`sellerId` (database-associated only) |
| DestinationBinding Operator-Independent Survivability | **NOT DEMONSTRATED** — section 18.4; no signature, no hash, no deterministic derivation, no ruleset constraint of any kind |
| Authority -> Outcome Independent Binding | **PARTIAL / DEMONSTRATED CONDITIONALLY** — section 18.6 Question B; holds once `buyerId`/`sellerId` are trusted |
| Outcome -> Destination Independent Binding | **NOT DEMONSTRATED** — section 18.6 Question C; this is the one real break point in the entire chain |
| Interaction Reconstructability | **NOT DEMONSTRATED** — section 13; distinct from, and not rescued by, Protocol Semantic Reconstructability above |
| Participant Portability | **NOT DEMONSTRATED** — section 14/17; zero export/backup capability, though T4 has real natural availability (section 13b) short of a true export mechanism |
| Public-Surface Minimization | **DEMONSTRATED** — section 20; `INV-OP-10`, three real closed violations, RFC-008's own rejections; kept explicitly distinct from Participant Portability |
| Operator Disappearance Survivability | **NOT DEMONSTRATED** — the mission's central question; DestinationBinding alone is sufficient to keep this NOT DEMONSTRATED even though Authority Facts are stronger than previously stated |
| Hostile Operator Equivocation Resistance | **PARTIAL, precisely classified as C, not A or B-with-mutation** — section 18.5; T4 resists it; the Outcome->Destination link does not, though no dynamic exploit was demonstrated and none was manufactured to inflate the finding |

## 23. Implementation Defects

**Zero.** Every finding above is an honestly-scoped gap or limitation
against an independently-derived property, not a violation of any
currently-claimed property. No repository code was found to
misrepresent its own scope.

## 24. Architectural Gaps (reported, not fixed)

1. `hashOutcomeContent()` exists, is tested, and is never wired to
   protect the one thing it was built to protect.
2. `DestinationBinding` has no commitment mechanism anywhere in
   `@sails/core` or the runtime layer.
3. `EscrowEvent`/`DurableEventRecord` hash chains both anchor at a
   hardcoded, non-externally-verified `'genesis'` sentinel.
4. No export/backup/data-portability capability exists for any
   protocol-relevant fact.
5. The arbiter's signing key is a plain, operator-controlled database
   column, never independently self-anchored.

None of these were fixed. Per the mission's own gate, a discovered
architectural gap is reported, not implemented.

## 25. Smallest Defensible Claim (precision pass)

**Confirmed, narrowed in one place and strengthened in another relative
to the prior pass — not broadened overall:**

**"Sails demonstrates independently verifiable signed Authority Facts —
authenticatable without operator trust, and naturally available to three
real parties (arbiter, buyer, seller) by construction, not by any export
feature — and tested public-surface minimization on selected protocol
surfaces (`INV-OP-10`). Outcome content is conditionally
operator-independent, derivable from the signed decision plus
independently-obtainable context. It does not currently demonstrate
independent binding between Outcome and DestinationBinding — the one
point in the entire authority-to-execution chain that breaks — nor does
it provide any participant-facing export/portability mechanism for
interaction-specific facts."**

Attacked against 18.2-18.6: every clause is directly supported.
"Naturally available... not by any export feature" corrects the prior
pass's implicit T4 understatement (section 13b). "Conditionally
operator-independent" corrects the prior pass's implicit T5
overstatement of the gap (section 18.3). "The one point... that breaks"
is now precisely located, not a broad "Outcome/DestinationBinding are
both unprotected" claim.

Deliberately not: Sails is decentralized; Sails survives Satsails
disappearance; operator-independent history; censorship resistance;
immutable history; trustless persistence; permissionless continuation;
complete credible exit; portable history; independently verifiable
history; second-implementation readiness — none of these are supported
without qualification by the evidence above.

## 26. NOT PROVEN

- Unconditional operator-independent survivability of Outcome content
  (it is only conditionally derivable — section 18.3).
- Any operator-independent survivability of DestinationBinding at all
  (the one link with no derivability, no signature, no hash — section 18.4).
- Any form of participant data export/portability (distinct from T4's
  natural, non-export-based availability — section 13b).
- External anchoring of any hash-chain genesis point.
- Durable retention of a signed Authority decision by the arbiter's or
  a party's own client, once received — plausible by construction, not
  confirmed either way (section 13b).
- That an outside party can confirm the arbiter's registered public key
  was genuinely theirs at decision time, independent of the operator's
  own database.
- Universal, global, or public availability of any fact class (not
  attempted — see Privacy Red Team, section 20, this is correctly not a
  goal).
- Replication, decentralized storage, or any specific mechanism —
  correctly out of scope per this mission's own anti-solutionism gate.
- Full K3 conformance, full Sails conformance, formal verification,
  production readiness of any kind.

## 27. COBRA / Goodhart Check

- **Did we define Protocol Truth as whatever the database contains?**
  No — section 5 explicitly attacked and refined the candidate
  definition before touching implementation.
- **Did we confuse PostgreSQL durability with operator independence?**
  No — section 16 states this distinction explicitly against Recovery
  Conformance's own evidence.
- **Did we maximize retained data instead of minimum sufficient truth?**
  No — section 8 challenged every fact class individually; none was
  added merely for completeness.
- **Did we assume portable means public?** No — section 20 explicitly
  preserves the distinction, backed by real, already-demonstrated
  `INV-OP-10` evidence.
- **Did we create surveillance in the name of survivability?** No — no
  new disclosure mechanism was proposed at all.
- **Did we assume signed means semantically reconstructable?** No —
  section 18 is precisely the finding that signed (T4) does NOT imply
  the bound consequence (T5/T6) is reconstructable.
- **Did we assume a hash is useful when underlying data is unavailable?**
  No — section 9's matrix treats availability and verifiability as
  separate columns throughout.
- **Did we treat external chain data as sufficient to reconstruct
  economic meaning?** No — T7's on-chain observability is explicitly
  scoped to "what happened," never conflated with "why it was
  authorized" (Final Principles, directly addressed in section 18).
- **Did we treat historical observation as current reality?** No —
  section 21 explicitly defers to Recovery evidence's own already-
  demonstrated distinction.
- **Did we treat exportability as independent verifiability?** No —
  section 14 keeps all four dimensions (readable/exportable/portable/
  self-verifying) separately scored.
- **Did we treat replication as decentralization?** No — M12 explicitly
  states no replication exists to evaluate.
- **Did we make the reference implementation the specification?** No —
  M11 explicitly cites the independently-derived Kernel/Core/conformance
  material as the actual specification.
- **Did we propose mechanisms before deriving the property?** No — no
  storage/transport/anchoring mechanism is proposed anywhere in this
  document; sections 2's anti-solutionism gate was followed throughout.
- **Did we invent architecture because the implementation lacks
  something?** No — section 24 reports gaps without proposing fixes;
  no new primitive, registry, or abstraction is introduced.
- **Did we broaden the claim to make the mission look successful?** No —
  section 25's claim is narrower than F03's own original candidate
  obligation, not broader.

**Precision-pass-specific additions:**
- **Did we infer absence of all binding from one unused helper?**
  Corrected — section 18.3 explicitly separates "no call site" (a narrow
  fact) from "no binding exists" (which turned out false for Outcome,
  true for DestinationBinding, established by tracing derivation, not
  by the helper's absence).
- **Did we confuse transactional association with independent
  verification?** Corrected — section 18.2's table marks the M8-R
  snapshot as "TRANSACTIONALLY ASSOCIATED," never conflated with
  independent verifiability.
- **Did we call operator reassociation demonstrated without
  demonstrating it?** Corrected — section 18.5 reclassifies from an
  unqualified claim to C, explicitly declining to manufacture A.
- **Did we assume cryptographic hashing is the only valid binding
  mechanism?** No — section 18.3 credits deterministic derivation as a
  real, sufficient binding mechanism for Outcome content.
- **Did we overlook deterministic derivation?** Corrected in this pass
  — section 18.3 is new.
- **Did we confuse signature authenticity with availability?**
  Corrected — section 13b separates them into distinct rows.
- **Did we infer no external T4 copy merely from lack of export
  endpoint?** Corrected — section 13b.
- **Did we claim portability while simultaneously reporting no export
  mechanism?** No — section 14/22 keep Participant Portability as NOT
  DEMONSTRATED throughout, including after the T4 correction.
- **Did we confuse protocol reconstructability with interaction
  reconstructability?** Corrected — section 13 now states both as
  explicit, separately-labeled sub-verdicts.
- **Did we turn the backlog gap into a preferred implementation?** No —
  section 30's renamed delta explicitly rejects mechanism-flavored names.
- **Did we broaden the claim because the finding looks important?** No
  — section 25's claim is narrower in one place (Outcome) and stronger
  in another (T4 availability) than the prior pass; net scope is not
  broadened.

No STOP triggered by this check.

## 28. Files Changed

One new file: `docs/DURABLE_PROTOCOL_TRUTH_EVIDENCE.md`. No production
code, no tests, no schema, no Core, no Kernel, no Constitution, no SDK,
no settlement providers modified.

## 29. Final Verdict

**B — IMPORTANT PIECES EXIST, BUT MATERIAL OPERATOR DEPENDENCIES REMAIN**

Real, demonstrated strength exists (Authority Facts, privacy-preserving
minimization, on-chain execution facts, real external timestamp
anchoring capability, real append-only hash-chained history). Material,
precisely-located gaps remain — most severely, the complete absence of
any cryptographic binding between the one thing that IS signed
(Authority) and the two things that most need protecting (Outcome
content, and especially DestinationBinding), plus zero participant
export capability for any fact. Not C: nothing found actively violates
a stated property — every gap is an honest absence, not a broken
guarantee. Not STOP: no material contradiction among normative sources
was found (the one discrepancy found, section 4, is a stale Project
card vs. real code — not a normative conflict).

## 30. Backlog Delta (refined — property-oriented name, not a preferred mechanism)

**BACKLOG DELTA DETECTED** — the same underlying finding as the prior
pass, renamed to name the missing *property*, not a *preferred
mechanism* ("hash Outcome," "sign DestinationBinding," "add a Merkle
root," "anchor Outcome" were all considered and explicitly rejected as
names — each smuggles in a specific implementation the investigation is
not authorized to prescribe):

**Independent Verifiability of Authority -> Outcome -> Destination
Binding.** The durable question this delta records, unchanged from
section 2/18.1: *can an independent verifier establish, without
trusting operator-held database associations, that a specific Outcome
and DestinationBinding are the authorized consequence of a specific
signed Authority decision?* Precision-pass finding (18.2-18.6): the
Authority-decision link is already independently verifiable; the
Authority->Outcome link is conditionally independently verifiable
(given `buyerId`/`sellerId`); the Outcome->DestinationBinding link is
where independent verifiability actually stops, and this holds even for
MULTISIG, the one rail with every other part of the chain real. This
does **not** become "another" delta merely because its name changed
from the prior pass — same finding, sharper name, same non-answer on
mechanism. Not implemented, not Project-synced, by this mission (no
such authority granted).

## 30b. Project Drift

**PROJECT DRIFT: DETECTED.** The "OpenProof — Registry, Evidence
Provider & Timestamp Anchor" Project card's claim that
`TimestampAnchor`/`AnchorProof` are "genuinely not started" is directly
contradicted by RFC-008's own text and by `src/modules/open-proof/timestamp-anchor.ts`'s
real, live-wired `anchor()` implementation (section 4). Reported and
classified as **stale-bookkeeping drift, not a new architectural
backlog delta** — the underlying capability is real; only the Project's
own description of it is wrong. Not resolved, not Project-synced, by
this mission (no Project write authority; explicitly not the main
mission per the CTO's own instruction).
