  // docs/TEST_HARNESS_RELIABILITY.md (TECHNICAL_DEBT_AUDIT.md #59,
  // 2026-09-08 — distinct from item #57, which is a different, still-open
  // finding about buildApp() timeout contention under parallel Jest load)
  // — the same class of failure, a different source: the Agent tool's
  // `isolation: "worktree"`
  // feature (and any other tool that runs `git worktree add`) leaves a
  // full checkout, including its own `packages/sails-sdk/package.json`,
  // under `.claude/worktrees/<name>/` whenever a spawned agent makes
  // changes (its worktree is only auto-removed when it makes none).
  // Jest's own haste-map has no concept of "this directory is a git
  // worktree, not product source" — it indexes every package.json under
  // `roots` by its declared `name` field, so as few as ONE stray worktree
  // (confirmed empirically: excluding 3 of 4 present at investigation
  // time still reproduced the identical failure with the remaining one)
  // reintroduces the exact `@satsails/p2p-trading-sdk` name collision
  // `dist/`'s own exclusion above was written to prevent, breaking any
  // suite whose import graph reaches `safe-guard-evm.provider.ts`
  // (`escrow.service.ts` → `escrow-providers.ts` → that file's own
  // `@satsails/p2p-trading-sdk` import). This directory is never part of
  // this repository's own product source or test surface regardless of
  // whether a worktree currently happens to exist under it — it should
  // never be scanned by Jest at all, the same "correct general exclusion"
  // reasoning as `dist/` above, not a workaround specific to today's
  // leftover worktrees.

  // no real CJS entry point, even on its "require" condition. Jest's own

  // `@arkade-os/sdk`'s own dependency tree turned out to have several

  // node_modules by this same tree, no real CJS entry even on its
  // "require" condition), `micro-packed` (@scure/btc-signer/musig2.js's
  // dependency), a NESTED `@scure/base` copy under
  // node_modules/@arkade-os/sdk/node_modules/, and `@marcbachmann/cel-js`
  // (surfaced only once `safeGuardEvmProvider.test.ts` imported
  // `@satsails/p2p-trading-sdk`'s full barrel, which pulls in escrow-ark-signing.ts's
  // real `@arkade-os/sdk` import). Allowlisting each by name as it
  // surfaces doesn't scale — an empty transformIgnorePatterns (transform
  // everything, node_modules included) is the robust fix: ts-jest
  // downlevel-compiles real ESM/modern syntax to CJS the same way it
